blorg,"I use [this light from AliExpress,](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33052501051.html) $15, mounts using a GoPro mount. They sell it with these dual out front mounts that also take a Garmin which is what I use but you can get [little individual mounts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32516607971.html) for it too if you don't have a Garmin, only a few dollars. That light is great, too, it has an actual good pattern with a vertical cut-off so the light goes onto the road, not into oncoming motorists' eyes.

This uses an allen key for attachment, they *could* still steal it if they had one but it's much less likely. You could also replace the regular allen-head bolt with a [security bolt](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33048888632.html), these just use a Torx head with a pin that you need a [particular tool](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000687541265.html) to remove, that a random opportunist is very unlikely to be carrying.

The other alternative is to take it off. There are mounts [that are open to the top](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32735169560.html) that it's much easier to to pull the light out of quickly. If you are taking it on and off constantly, it has to be super-easy to do or you will get frustrated or not do it.

Or finally, stick it on your helmet. I have a Lezyne mount on my helmet that takes a round flashlight-style light. Then it's with you all the time.

Interesting thing is that the PSA says any interest earned from e-wallet moneys should accrue to the user unless otherwise agreed.

We received an online order on a busy night and we had ran out of turmeric rice. Before accepting the order, we called the customer and informed them if they would like a change to white rice or a cancellation of the item.

I once ordered Mac for $13, the order was screwed up by Mac themselves except for the drink.

The agent then proceed to tell me I can either get a refund of $3, or a compensation voucher of $5 that can be use for future orders. 

Of course like any sane customer with a brain, that doesn't even make any sense. Why would I, who received the wrong items accept that offer, the $3 refund in fact only covers the cost of the drink that I actually received correctly. I questioned the agent, he/she then proceed to say ""yes and that's why i asked if you received the order partially, and you said yes"". Like cmon, all they are trying to do is to fish for a response that can let them refund as little as possible.
