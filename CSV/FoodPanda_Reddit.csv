I think the restaurant has the responsibility to tell the sender the time he or she has to wait for the food being prepared.  The Food Panda also should tell senders the time limit to wait a food under process.,Surnamelast,2020-10-17 19:28:46,18,,/r/singapore/comments/jct4pm/stacking_deliveries_on_foodpanda/
"I did foodpanda for a while last time. They seem to have no limit on the number of stack if there's really no other rider in the area.

One time when it was raining heavily, I got like 5 stack orders at the same time from subway. Luckily some were just ala carte sandwiches and 2 of the orders were for different levels in the same block.

I've seen screenshots of ridiculous stack up to 10+ on public holidays in high demand areas. No idea how the rider did those deliveries.",,2020-10-17 22:11:39,6,,/r/singapore/comments/jct4pm/stacking_deliveries_on_foodpanda/

Safety- will the shelter lead to people climbing up and assessing your neighbour's home?
Beneficiaries- how many people get to benefit from it?  Even though a facility may be enjoyed by many, but if safety is a problem, they will not build it too.
Funding- does the tc have enough funding?

"> Medics are allowed (and obligated) to overrule superior officers in situations involving the medical care of soldiers.

I don't know how true this is to be honest. This sounds like those tales that NSFs tell but nobody knows if its legit because its too logical and SAF isn't logical. For example, SAF drivers during my time even if there was an emergency have to keep to the 50KM speed limit. Only with a waiver and approval command by the Vehicle commander can it exceed. 

There was one time some guy got stung badly at murai and had an allergic reaction. So my mate got activated to ambulance him over to the hospital. Had to go through vcom approval etc. Lucky the vcom also scared to get in trouble so just say ok go ahead zoom to hospital. But if the vcom say no, then the driver also lan lan suck thumb stick to 50KM otherwise what the fuck is the point of that protocol?

Ya I know its not a medic but the scenario is very similar, in the event an emergency happens and the standing order is no, what do?",Orangecuppa,2020-09-26 23:13:56,25,,/r/singapore/comments/j01hsb/anyone_find_the_dave_lee_case_outcome_ridiculous/

"Worked as a foodpanda cyclist for about 3 months after NS and here are my opinions on foodpanda.
The process for an order are in 3 phases 
1) accepting the order
2) collecting the order
3) delivering the order

We had 15 minutes to collect the order and 15 minutes to deliver. At every process there is always a problem. 

Before even accepting the order the 15 minute timer has already elapsed. The order is already allocated to a Rider, if I as a rider didn’t accept it because I haven’t completed my previous order or whatsoever, the algorithm will send it to another rider. Sometimes there aren’t enough riders , so the wait just continues.

When collecting the order, some places are extremely busy especially at zi char stores. These stores aren’t well equipped or have a system in place for delivery services. Usually they prioritize the customers physically at their store and so the wait continues. Once I waited 1hr for 2 packet of fried rice.

Delivering the order, it’s a matter of following the GPS and just cycling. The only possible fuck up here is if you put your address wrong. The only problem is usually condominiums, sometimes the security system is so fucking annoying requiring you to do 10000 steps and the customer never wants to collect the food from the guard house. And sometimes the security guard is a  cunt.",sourpower321,2019-05-06 18:54:33,43,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/
"I don't think the problem is with the riders. A majority of people do not fault the riders, the ones that do are assholes. Period.

Foodpanda and their various competitors are the ones at fault here. Setting ridiculous timings for food to be delivered is really asking for complaints to be made. The poor riders, as the face of the deliveries, would eventually pay for this poor managerial decision. 

For example, if one were to go on Foodpanda and order a meal from a foodplace, the app would give an estimate timing of delivery (e.g 20mins). This thing is, the customer would assume that after paying for their food, it would be delivered in 20mins. This is not the case. Foodpanda would firstly have to allocate the rider for the job - this takes time. A lot of it. Meanwhile, the 20mins timer would have already start counting down.

If it takes 15mins for the rider to be allocated, the estimated timing should indicate 35mins, right? Well, Foodpanda does not seem to think so. I have seen this from Grab too. Suggestions to suspend food places does to not seem to be working effectively and efficently. (Only during peak periods, for what I have observed.)

The number 1 place where delivery is seemingly consistent, more often than not, and would always set a benchmark in the food delivery business is non other than Mcdelivery. 

The rest of the industry players really need to improve their delivery processes. The only good thing they have going for them is price.

"> sometimes the security system is so fucking annoying requiring you to do 10000 steps and the customer never wants to collect the food from the guard house. And sometimes the security guard is a cunt

yesterday when I ordered Pizzas, I was thinking the same. Maybe, for food delivery guys they should have a different system. Normally, they ask him to add his details, the receiver's details, packet details, etc. Instead, they should take a picture of him and ask where he wants to go - the guy can deliver and later while returning he can provide the details. Or the security guard can collect his ID and allow him to deliver first (so the customer gets their food fast and hot, rider gets to reach there on time, and anyhow the details can be filled at security cabin).",,2019-05-06 19:43:25,7,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/

"Tbh McD is still better than a lot of companies’ deliveries, even the ones that have to worry about themselves. I’ve ordered so many times from KFC and it’s always been later than the time given. I’ve tried emailing customer support but they never got back with why they set the timing so early. 

Agreed that McD is different vs Foodpanda and Grabfood, but the time allocated to find a rider should be added into the time given, maybe giving about a generous average time (~15 minutes or so during non-peak hours?) and the actual time food would be delivered. 

There’ll be people who would rather have early/on-time drivers, and hence trust that company more, than one who constantly has drivers not deliver the food ‘on time’ . And when word-of-mouth gets around, plus smart marketing, there’ll be people who switch over. Companies can appear more sympathetic and appreciative towards their drivers like this, which plays on people’s heartstrings and make them think “oh, that’s a company I’d support”.",niiiveous,2019-05-06 17:32:23,9,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/

">	It’s rather shortsighted to refuse to express slightly more care and consideration during this period.

Can you point out the part where I said that? 

I said that fasting for health or religious purposes must not be used as an excuse to reduce productivity at the expense of the business. 

Both the employer and employee could of course try to find ways around it (e.g providing snack/power bars to support riders who choose to work through dinnertime without breaking fast) - it is up to them to figure out a win-win solution.

Are clearing trays specifically part of a cleaner's jobs? If they are, of course the cleaners should do their jobs. 

If they are not, then I support raising civic consciousness to help keep hawker places tidy. But which is which?

"Happened to me once. Ordered McDonalds. Everything goes as per normal within the time frame given. Order received, driver assigned, driver at the restaurant, driver is on the way, then order delivered. I thought, maybe the driver accidentally pressed the “delivered” button on his phone, so I waited 15 more minutes. Still no show. Call the driver, he picked up and said that it’s delivered and he has passed the food to somebody. 
Since I lived in condo, the security has to intercom me whenever there’s any visitor for my unit. So, I went down and asked the security, both the security guard said there’s no food delivery coming in on the last 30 mins. I was hangry. I ordered another food (still with GrabFood, what can I say, I like to collect points) and it arrive safely to me. I don’t even bother calling their customer service. I sent an email to them, they said they’ll investigate and 1 hour later give me a coupon code for $5 or $10 off (can’t rem) and fully refund back my McD purchase.

My guess is the driver ran away with my McD as it’s too tempting to resist. Or, maybe he’s just hungry.

"not sure bout other services (should be the same) but for grab, there's a distance ceiling within which bicycle riders are obliged to travel - any further and we can request dispatch to reassign the order. that probably explains the consecutive cancellations - sometimes the distance on bicycle is just too far, and the time needed to deliver your food to you is going to be very very long, so we'd rather cancel and let dispatch give it to a motorcycle (hopefully) because their distance ceiling is much much higher and they can get your food to you quicker as well. (but typically it just goes back into the general pool and it's a matter of luck whether you'll get a motorcycle).",yeeez1,2020-03-21 22:28:33,1,,/r/singapore/comments/fmcc0n/temporarily_lift_the_pmd_ban_for_food_deliveries/

I never got anything and had to contact my bank about it, who then cancelled my card and had me get a new one, then returned the money to me.
