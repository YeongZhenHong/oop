I think the restaurant has the responsibility to tell the sender the time he or she has to wait for the food being prepared.  The Food Panda also should tell senders the time limit to wait a food under process.,19,2020-10-17,19:28:46
"I did foodpanda for a while last time. They seem to have no limit on the number of stack if there's really no other rider in the area.

One time when it was raining heavily, I got like 5 stack orders at the same time from subway. Luckily some were just ala carte sandwiches and 2 of the orders were for different levels in the same block.

I've seen screenshots of ridiculous stack up to 10+ on public holidays in high demand areas. No idea how the rider did those deliveries.",5,2020-10-17,22:11:39
"It's not in the rider's interest to not do the stack. It's more efficient, they make more money. Customer complains, that's foodpanda's problem now, not theirs. They still get paid.",10,2020-10-17,23:58:44
"Send a complaint to Grab and Deliveroo while you’re at it, since they do stacked orders too",-1,2020-10-17,19:00:23
"Getting your own food means not having to deal with this problem. Alternatively pay someone to just pick up only your food and no one else's. Again the problem is fixed it.

What you're really asking for is mass market priced services at individual service levels

The issue here wasn't waiting for the food to be prepared. The issue here is the food being prepared already and being left cold because the rider is forced to wait for another order.,1,2020-10-17,22:33:11

"If riders decline the order, it would lower their acceptance rate and affect their batch.

"I understand how you feel. I have many friends who are equally frustrated with them. One was vehement to correct anyone who said that they have horrible customer service, because there is no service to begin with!  


Guess what, after getting a long exchange of emails going and finally ascertaining that there is a contradiction between their version (rider arrived at my doorstep) and my version of what happened (rider claimed that he cancelled because he wasn't provided my unit number), they decided to acknowledge that they are ""sorry for causing the mishap"". But alas! They still refuse to refund even a partial amount for leading to my incident.",3,2018-07-25,23:28:24
"Starbucks have a customer-centric policy. I recently went to the zoo and along with my order, asked for a babycinno (free). My friend who was with me then went back to ask for one for his toddler. 

The guy said to wait while he finish up some orders, but forgot about it, leaving my friend to stand there for say... About ten minutes? 

After a while, he noticed my friend standing at the side and admitted that he forgot the order and apologised. What happened next caught us by surprise. Barista gave my friend a complimentary drink voucher. 

Summary: Barista forgot to make a free drink for friend. Still compensated with complimentary drink voucher.

Safety- will the shelter lead to people climbing up and assessing your neighbour's home?
Beneficiaries- how many people get to benefit from it?  Even though a facility may be enjoyed by many, but if safety is a problem, they will not build it too.
Funding- does the tc have enough funding?

"It’s my first day delivering food so I’m not extremely familiar with the system but I think distance is accounted for. Riders earn more when the distance is further but whether it’s worth the extra dollar or so is debatable. 

I think most riders generally will want shorter trips but they might not reject long distance trips too bc it affects their acceptance rate. 

Yeh I think outlets sometimes stop orders from coming in maybe bc it’s overloaded? But since u said random times, I am not really sure.

I once had to take an order from Bukit Batok to Bukit Timah, not very far for me but the amount of climbing really wears you out FAST.
2) Redispatch orders if you've been waiting at the restaurant for >20mins past pick up time. Better to cut your losses and accept other orders then wait more and deal with a potentially angry customer

The only fault was the measures taken when Dave collapse. To send the 3SGs to jail for this is unreasonable, as they were doing something that was taught by their seniors.

"> Medics are allowed (and obligated) to overrule superior officers in situations involving the medical care of soldiers.

I don't know how true this is to be honest. This sounds like those tales that NSFs tell but nobody knows if its legit because its too logical and SAF isn't logical. For example, SAF drivers during my time even if there was an emergency have to keep to the 50KM speed limit. Only with a waiver and approval command by the Vehicle commander can it exceed. 

There was one time some guy got stung badly at murai and had an allergic reaction. So my mate got activated to ambulance him over to the hospital. Had to go through vcom approval etc. Lucky the vcom also scared to get in trouble so just say ok go ahead zoom to hospital. But if the vcom say no, then the driver also lan lan suck thumb stick to 50KM otherwise what the fuck is the point of that protocol?

Ya I know its not a medic but the scenario is very similar, in the event an emergency happens and the standing order is no, what do?",24,2020-09-26,23:13:56

"Worked as a foodpanda cyclist for about 3 months after NS and here are my opinions on foodpanda.
The process for an order are in 3 phases 
1) accepting the order
2) collecting the order
3) delivering the order

We had 15 minutes to collect the order and 15 minutes to deliver. At every process there is always a problem. 

Before even accepting the order the 15 minute timer has already elapsed. The order is already allocated to a Rider, if I as a rider didn’t accept it because I haven’t completed my previous order or whatsoever, the algorithm will send it to another rider. Sometimes there aren’t enough riders , so the wait just continues.

When collecting the order, some places are extremely busy especially at zi char stores. These stores aren’t well equipped or have a system in place for delivery services. Usually they prioritize the customers physically at their store and so the wait continues. Once I waited 1hr for 2 packet of fried rice.

Delivering the order, it’s a matter of following the GPS and just cycling. The only possible fuck up here is if you put your address wrong. The only problem is usually condominiums, sometimes the security system is so fucking annoying requiring you to do 10000 steps and the customer never wants to collect the food from the guard house. And sometimes the security guard is a  cunt.",41,2019-05-06,18:54:33
"I don't think the problem is with the riders. A majority of people do not fault the riders, the ones that do are assholes. Period.

Foodpanda and their various competitors are the ones at fault here. Setting ridiculous timings for food to be delivered is really asking for complaints to be made. The poor riders, as the face of the deliveries, would eventually pay for this poor managerial decision. 

For example, if one were to go on Foodpanda and order a meal from a foodplace, the app would give an estimate timing of delivery (e.g 20mins). This thing is, the customer would assume that after paying for their food, it would be delivered in 20mins. This is not the case. Foodpanda would firstly have to allocate the rider for the job - this takes time. A lot of it. Meanwhile, the 20mins timer would have already start counting down.

If it takes 15mins for the rider to be allocated, the estimated timing should indicate 35mins, right? Well, Foodpanda does not seem to think so. I have seen this from Grab too. Suggestions to suspend food places does to not seem to be working effectively and efficently. (Only during peak periods, for what I have observed.)

The number 1 place where delivery is seemingly consistent, more often than not, and would always set a benchmark in the food delivery business is non other than Mcdelivery. 

The rest of the industry players really need to improve their delivery processes. The only good thing they have going for them is price.

Normally there’s a timer for every order you receive. Sometimes it’s 13 or 10 mins. Worst is when it’s like -5 mins. It’s probably an order which another rider rejected or something. 

But what’s even worst is when you’re early to pick up the food but the vendor takes like 30 mins to prepare it. Then because of them, we have to rush ourselves. 

A lot of the customers don’t complain when I send them late & I’m thankful.

yesterday when I ordered Pizzas, I was thinking the same. Maybe, for food delivery guys they should have a different system. Normally, they ask him to add his details, the receiver's details, packet details, etc. Instead, they should take a picture of him and ask where he wants to go - the guy can deliver and later while returning he can provide the details. Or the security guard can collect his ID and allow him to deliver first (so the customer gets their food fast and hot, rider gets to reach there on time, and anyhow the details can be filled at security cabin).",6,2019-05-06,19:43:25

Agreed that McD is different vs Foodpanda and Grabfood, but the time allocated to find a rider should be added into the time given, maybe giving about a generous average time (~15 minutes or so during non-peak hours?) and the actual time food would be delivered. 

There’ll be people who would rather have early/on-time drivers, and hence trust that company more, than one who constantly has drivers not deliver the food ‘on time’ . And when word-of-mouth gets around, plus smart marketing, there’ll be people who switch over.

Limit the time where restaurants (or foodpanda themselves) can choose to accept/cancel orders to say, 15 minutes, to make it less frustrating for us.",5,2019-05-06,18:50:19

">	It’s rather shortsighted to refuse to express slightly more care and consideration during this period.

Can you point out the part where I said that? 

I said that fasting for health or religious purposes must not be used as an excuse to reduce productivity at the expense of the business. 

Both the employer and employee could of course try to find ways around it (e.g providing snack/power bars to support riders who choose to work through dinnertime without breaking fast) - it is up to them to figure out a win-win solution.

Are clearing trays specifically part of a cleaner's jobs? If they are, of course the cleaners should do their jobs. 

If they are not, then I support raising civic consciousness to help keep hawker places tidy. But which is which? This is a poor example to use btw - it's completely unrelated to the question at hand.",6,2019-05-06,22:07:59

Tbh the only time I use grabfood is when there is a coupon code of macdonald,21,2019-05-03,21:57:59
"Happened to me once. Ordered McDonalds. Everything goes as per normal within the time frame given. Order received, driver assigned, driver at the restaurant, driver is on the way, then order delivered. I thought, maybe the driver accidentally pressed the “delivered” button on his phone, so I waited 15 more minutes. Still no show. Call the driver, he picked up and said that it’s delivered and he has passed the food to somebody. 
Since I lived in condo, the security has to intercom me whenever there’s any visitor for my unit. So, I went down and asked the security, both the security guard said there’s no food delivery coming in on the last 30 mins. I was hangry. I ordered another food (still with GrabFood, what can I say, I like to collect points) and it arrive safely to me. I don’t even bother calling their customer service. I sent an email to them, they said they’ll investigate and 1 hour later give me a coupon code for $5 or $10 off (can’t rem) and fully refund back my McD purchase.

My guess is the driver ran away with my McD as it’s too tempting to resist. Or, maybe he’s just hungry.
Can’t place the blame fully to Grab tho, sometimes when you’re having an unlucky day, these thing happens.",16,2019-05-03,23:24:40
Their app update SUCKS. For some goddamn reason they decided to merge it back into the main Grab app and now you can only place one order at a time instead of being able to place several. Godammit.,7,2019-05-04,01:01:08

Fuuuuuuck that. I deleted Foodpanda ASAP.",6,2019-05-04,01:47:13

"Grabfood requires top up to their eWallet, and that's the reason I refused to use it. eWallet promotes impulsive spending as users often want to spend away any remaining credit in their eWallet. Topping up and not using the app would be a waste, hence it's a great ""lock-in"" mechanism for Grabfood to maintain it's user base. Comparing it to Foodpanda, it allows COD, so I never had the urge to overspend, so far the service has been satisfactory.",1,2019-05-03,22:28:13
"Sounds like you had a pretty crappy experience! I've been lucky in that I've actually had pretty good experiences with Grab Food so far.

Called the restaurant directly after 2 hrs and they were still waiting for the driver to pick up. In the end I got food that was prepared over 2hrs beforehand.

They promised me some compensation and to wait for an email from them. I never received an email, still had to pay for the food and so I cancelled my account.

I work as a rider for another food delivery company. There are times too when I receive orders that are to be delivered at a later timing. The problem I think lies with the merchants.

"> There are many occasions with no acceptance for an hour or consecutive cancellation because it is simply out of the way for bicycles.

I don't understand this. If its out of the way for bicycles, wouldn't it be out of the way for PMDs given that they are allowed to use the same infrastructure?",3,2020-03-21,17:44:18
"PMD is not something cheap. It costs at least a few hundreds dollars. It does not make sense to unban for a few months, then make it banned after that. Should they buy a new PMD now if it is unbanned, and knowing that it will be banned after this?

And, to point 5, it is the opposite here at least at my area. People are not going out to the town, shopping malls, ect, so the kids, the seniors all come down to the little playground here, or void deck, and the park next door. Outdoor, less risk.",2,2020-03-21,17:28:16
"Agree with point 2. Not the rest. Food delivery is still available without pmd. Before the pmd explosion, motorcycles were the Mainstays. Don't see why that should change that much.",5,2020-03-21,17:21:53

Definitely still available! But I do experience as a service that it is not as efficient as it used to be prior to the PMD ban.,-9,2020-03-21,17:24:00
"not sure bout other services (should be the same) but for grab, there's a distance ceiling within which bicycle riders are obliged to travel - any further and we can request dispatch to reassign the order. that probably explains the consecutive cancellations - sometimes the distance on bicycle is just too far, and the time needed to deliver your food to you is going to be very very long, so we'd rather cancel and let dispatch give it to a motorcycle (hopefully) because their distance ceiling is much much higher and they can get your food to you quicker as well. (but typically it just goes back into the general pool and it's a matter of luck whether you'll get a motorcycle).",1,2020-03-21,22:28:33
Not as efficient for the rider in the sense that need to walk more?,3,2020-03-21,17:27:59

Personally, I won't recommend nomnomby. Terrible customer service. If you want to get a subscription, mealpal is much better.",9,2019-06-10,17:11:20
"Just a heads up on Whyq -- I ordered from them a week ago and their customer service was horrendous to get through just to cancel the order (Kept hanging up on me 3-4 times) since the rider was over 2 hours late. They said they'd cancel, but they ended up charging my card and the process was marked as 'completed' on my app. I called again to get a refund with the customer service representative promised me that their 'team' would get back to me within 24 hours after insisting that I got my food. 

&#x200B;

I never got anything and had to contact my bank about it, who then cancelled my card and had me get a new one, then returned the money to me. It wasn't a massive amount, but it was enough for me to never order again just because of how awful the experience was. Stick with Grabfood and Foodpanda, guys.",8,2019-06-10,21:34:13
"I find the grabfood delivery plan to be very worth it. For $8/month, you get a $5 off voucher + $10 off voucher AND 30 free deliveries. Can get bbt with free delivery, for example. 
Only downside is only one order at a time (i.e. you can't order lunch and bbt at the same time)",4,2019-06-10,21:27:50

"Last time can do multiple orders. Idk why they liddat now :((((((((( the ""update"" merging Grabfood into the Grab app was an all-around downgrade",3,2019-06-11,00:08:46
"as someone who uses GrabFood 3-5 times a week, I definitely noticed downgrades, you can't order food while you're in a Grab ride, you can't order a Grab if you have a pending GrabFood order, like what???? Also, some restaurants that were always there don't show up randomly, but the guy next to you pulls out his phone and it shows up on his phone somehow.",3,2019-06-11,22:53:39
