The Food Panda also should tell senders the time limit to wait a food under process.,2020-10-17 19:28:46,19,,,/r/singapore/comments/jct4pm/stacking_deliveries_on_foodpanda/
,"I did foodpanda for a while last time. They seem to have no limit on the number of stack if there's really no other rider in the area.

One time when it was raining heavily, I got like 5 stack orders at the same time from subway. Luckily some were just ala carte sandwiches and 2 of the orders were for different levels in the same block.

I've seen screenshots of ridiculous stack up to 10+ on public holidays in high demand areas. No idea how the rider did those deliveries.",2020-10-17 22:11:39,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/jct4pm/stacking_deliveries_on_foodpanda/

Beneficiaries- how many people get to benefit from it?  Even though a facility may be enjoyed by many, but if safety is a problem, they will not build it too.

Orangecuppa,"> Medics are allowed (and obligated) to overrule superior officers in situations involving the medical care of soldiers.

I don't know how true this is to be honest. This sounds like those tales that NSFs tell but nobody knows if its legit because its too logical and SAF isn't logical. For example, SAF drivers during my time even if there was an emergency have to keep to the 50KM speed limit. Only with a waiver and approval command by the Vehicle commander can it exceed. 

There was one time some guy got stung badly at murai and had an allergic reaction. So my mate got activated to ambulance him over to the hospital. Had to go through vcom approval etc. Lucky the vcom also scared to get in trouble so just say ok go ahead zoom to hospital. But if the vcom say no, then the driver also lan lan suck thumb stick to 50KM otherwise what the fuck is the point of that protocol?

Ya I know its not a medic but the scenario is very similar, in the event an emergency happens and the standing order is no, what do?",2020-09-26 23:13:56,25,,,/r/singapore/comments/j01hsb/anyone_find_the_dave_lee_case_outcome_ridiculous/

sourpower321,"Worked as a foodpanda cyclist for about 3 months after NS and here are my opinions on foodpanda.
The process for an order are in 3 phases 
1) accepting the order
2) collecting the order
3) delivering the order

We had 15 minutes to collect the order and 15 minutes to deliver. At every process there is always a problem. 

Before even accepting the order the 15 minute timer has already elapsed. The order is already allocated to a Rider, if I as a rider didn’t accept it because I haven’t completed my previous order or whatsoever, the algorithm will send it to another rider. Sometimes there aren’t enough riders , so the wait just continues.

When collecting the order, some places are extremely busy especially at zi char stores. These stores aren’t well equipped or have a system in place for delivery services. Usually they prioritize the customers physically at their store and so the wait continues. Once I waited 1hr for 2 packet of fried rice.

Delivering the order, it’s a matter of following the GPS and just cycling. The only possible fuck up here is if you put your address wrong. The only problem is usually condominiums, sometimes the security system is so fucking annoying requiring you to do 10000 steps and the customer never wants to collect the food from the guard house. And sometimes the security guard is a  cunt.",2019-05-06 18:54:33,46,,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/
Permanent_Secretary,"I don't think the problem is with the riders. A majority of people do not fault the riders, the ones that do are assholes. Period.

Foodpanda and their various competitors are the ones at fault here. Setting ridiculous timings for food to be delivered is really asking for complaints to be made. The poor riders, as the face of the deliveries, would eventually pay for this poor managerial decision. 

For example, if one were to go on Foodpanda and order a meal from a foodplace, the app would give an estimate timing of delivery (e.g 20mins). This thing is, the customer would assume that after paying for their food, it would be delivered in 20mins. This is not the case. Foodpanda would firstly have to allocate the rider for the job - this takes time. A lot of it. Meanwhile, the 20mins timer would have already start counting down.

If it takes 15mins for the rider to be allocated, the estimated timing should indicate 35mins, right? Well, Foodpanda does not seem to think so. I have seen this from Grab too. Suggestions to suspend food places does to not seem to be working effectively and efficently. (Only during peak periods, for what I have observed.)

The number 1 place where delivery is seemingly consistent, more often than not, and would always set a benchmark in the food delivery business is non other than Mcdelivery. 

The rest of the industry players really need to improve their delivery processes. The only good thing they have going for them is price.

Normally there’s a timer for every order you receive. Sometimes it’s 13 or 10 mins. Worst is when it’s like -5 mins. It’s probably an order which another rider rejected or something. 

But what’s even worst is when you’re early to pick up the food but the vendor takes like 30 mins to prepare it. Then because of them, we have to rush ourselves.

So guys, sometimes the delivery rider is busy waiting at our counters for your order to be fully cooked & packed while the customers queuing up at our counters are competing for our time, focus & resources too. So this is something that is neither their or companies like FoodPanda's fault.

yesterday when I ordered Pizzas, I was thinking the same. Maybe, for food delivery guys they should have a different system. Normally, they ask him to add his details, the receiver's details, packet details, etc. Instead, they should take a picture of him and ask where he wants to go - the guy can deliver and later while returning he can provide the details. Or the security guard can collect his ID and allow him to deliver first (so the customer gets their food fast and hot, rider gets to reach there on time, and anyhow the details can be filled at security cabin).",2019-05-06 19:43:25,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/

I’ve ordered so many times from KFC and it’s always been later than the time given. I’ve tried emailing customer support but they never got back with why they set the timing so early. 

Agreed that McD is different vs Foodpanda and Grabfood, but the time allocated to find a rider should be added into the time given, maybe giving about a generous average time (~15 minutes or so during non-peak hours?) and the actual time food would be delivered. 

There’ll be people who would rather have early/on-time drivers, and hence trust that company more, than one who constantly has drivers not deliver the food ‘on time’ . And when word-of-mouth gets around, plus smart marketing, there’ll be people who switch over. Companies can appear more sympathetic and appreciative towards their drivers like this, which plays on people’s heartstrings and make them think “oh, that’s a company I’d support”.",2019-05-06 17:32:23,9,,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/

james_dykeson,">	It’s rather shortsighted to refuse to express slightly more care and consideration during this period.

Can you point out the part where I said that? 

I said that fasting for health or religious purposes must not be used as an excuse to reduce productivity at the expense of the business. 

Both the employer and employee could of course try to find ways around it (e.g providing snack/power bars to support riders who choose to work through dinnertime without breaking fast) - it is up to them to figure out a win-win solution.

Are clearing trays specifically part of a cleaner's jobs? If they are, of course the cleaners should do their jobs. 

If they are not, then I support raising civic consciousness to help keep hawker places tidy. But which is which?

chubbycheeks90,"Happened to me once. Ordered McDonalds. Everything goes as per normal within the time frame given. Order received, driver assigned, driver at the restaurant, driver is on the way, then order delivered. I thought, maybe the driver accidentally pressed the “delivered” button on his phone, so I waited 15 more minutes. Still no show. Call the driver, he picked up and said that it’s delivered and he has passed the food to somebody. 
Since I lived in condo, the security has to intercom me whenever there’s any visitor for my unit. So, I went down and asked the security, both the security guard said there’s no food delivery coming in on the last 30 mins. I was hangry. I ordered another food (still with GrabFood, what can I say, I like to collect points) and it arrive safely to me. I don’t even bother calling their customer service. I sent an email to them, they said they’ll investigate and 1 hour later give me a coupon code for $5 or $10 off (can’t rem) and fully refund back my McD purchase.

My guess is the driver ran away with my McD as it’s too tempting to resist. Or, maybe he’s just hungry.

yeeez1,"not sure bout other services (should be the same) but for grab, there's a distance ceiling within which bicycle riders are obliged to travel - any further and we can request dispatch to reassign the order. that probably explains the consecutive cancellations - sometimes the distance on bicycle is just too far, and the time needed to deliver your food to you is going to be very very long, so we'd rather cancel and let dispatch give it to a motorcycle (hopefully) because their distance ceiling is much much higher and they can get your food to you quicker as well.

blorg,"I use [this light from AliExpress,](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33052501051.html) $15, mounts using a GoPro mount. They sell it with these dual out front mounts that also take a Garmin which is what I use but you can get [little individual mounts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32516607971.html) for it too if you don't have a Garmin, only a few dollars. That light is great, too, it has an actual good pattern with a vertical cut-off so the light goes onto the road, not into oncoming motorists' eyes.

This uses an allen key for attachment, they *could* still steal it if they had one but it's much less likely. You could also replace the regular allen-head bolt with a [security bolt](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33048888632.html), these just use a Torx head with a pin that you need a [particular tool](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000687541265.html) to remove, that a random opportunist is very unlikely to be carrying.

The other alternative is to take it off. There are mounts [that are open to the top](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32735169560.html) that it's much easier to to pull the light out of quickly. If you are taking it on and off constantly, it has to be super-easy to do or you will get frustrated or not do it.

Or finally, stick it on your helmet. I have a Lezyne mount on my helmet that takes a round flashlight-style light. Then it's with you all the time.

The rider said the shop ran out so they told him to pass this to me instead which was also fucking wrong value. No way would I pay $5 for that knock off chocolate. I said no but the rider begged me to just take it saying he will need to ride back to the shop to return. It was really a WTF moment.

Sometimes i wish these apps can inform customers if a particular restaurants have a high demand or if they are short of riders in a certain areas.

This would at least inform customers of their shortage of riders or if the restaurants has high demand so that customers can switch to grab/deliveroo or used other method.

Some restaurants can also be at fault for missing order/certain items has gone out ot stock,something that happen last year when my dad ordered prata for breakfast,only to receive some items missing.he tried to contact the CS,but they can't help it if the restaurant not willing to admit the mistakes.No refund as of now.",2021-03-18 20:34:50,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/m7n91b/first_post_here_anyone_used_foodpanda_please_be/

Interesting thing is that the PSA says any interest earned from e-wallet moneys should accrue to the user unless otherwise agreed.

weirdnawesome,"Just a theory, might be because your subscription signals a 'loyalty' to the app. You are likely already using it enough or have opted to pay, and therefore it takes less effort / costs less to keep you on. On the other hand, people not subscribed are not as loyal, and thus they throw more discounts to try to get them using the app to build up loyalty...

I mainly use pandapro for the additional 5% pickup discount. Pickup at certain stalls is much cheaper than ordering at the stall itself and you can beat the queue.

I work at a restaurant. 

We serve primarily turmeric rice with main course, unless white rice is requested. 

We received an online order on a busy night and we had ran out of turmeric rice. Before accepting the order, we called the customer and informed them if they would like a change to white rice or a cancellation of the item. 

In my opinion, it’s professional protocol/etiquette (of the restaurant) to inform the customer of any changes, regardless of how minor it is.",2021-03-10 00:53:58,33,,,/r/singapore/comments/m129f7/chicken_rice_with_no_chicken_man_rages_at/

SiHtranger,"More curious where did foodpanda even hire their customer service agents.

I once ordered Mac for $13, the order was screwed up by Mac themselves except for the drink. Contacted support and the main question they asked is ""so can I confirm you received the order wrong partially"". Since the drink was the only thing I got right, I responded ""yes"". The agent then proceed to tell me I can either get a refund of $3, or a compensation voucher of $5 that can be use for future orders. 

Of course like any sane customer with a brain, that doesn't even make any sense. Why would I, who received the wrong items accept that offer, the $3 refund in fact only covers the cost of the drink that I actually received correctly. I questioned the agent, he/she then proceed to say ""yes and that's why i asked if you received the order partially, and you said yes"". Like cmon, all they are trying to do is to fish for a response that can let them refund as little as possible.

Ended up have to start debating with the agent for my refund 🤔

He “dropped off” the order on the app so that he can gain the docket pay for this order without actually doing anything, and it also saves time waiting for the next order and travelling there (assuming he reached the vendor only to find out it’s closed).

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Police investigating case of 'harassment' involving foodpanda delivery orders at Joo Seng

> SINGAPORE: The police are investigating a case of ""intentional harassment"" involving foodpanda delivery orders that were sent to a Housing Board flat in Joo Seng, after a resident posted photos about ""prank orders"".

> The police said they were alerted to the incident at Block 7 Upper Aljunied Lane on Friday (Feb 19) at about 7.30pm.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Photos posted on Facebook on Friday night showed several foodpanda delivery riders, wearing the company's pink shirt, gathered at the foot of a housing block.

> Police officers can also be seen in the photos, which were posted by a user who said she is a resident of the estate.

>

> The resident wrote that 12 riders were gathered at the block, with ""more coming"".

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""Prank orders according to one of them,"" she wrote.

> Foodpanda is looking into the matter, a spokesperson for the company told CNA on Saturday.

> When asked about whether they were prank orders and if any payment was made for the orders, foodpanda said: ""The cash on delivery option is offered for users who may not have access to cashless payment options so as to offer an inclusive service to our customers.

> ""We appeal for the responsible use of food delivery services and cash on delivery option in consideration of food delivery riders who are working hard round the clock to deliver hot food to our homes.""

> 

> Advertisement

> In April last year, SPF issued an advisory saying that unlicensed moneylenders have increasingly been making use of food delivery services to harass debtors.

> ""The unlicensed moneylenders would order large quantities of food or make multiple orders on the same day, and arrange for the food to be delivered to the debtors' homes, often late at night,"" police said.

> Food was sometimes delivered to debtors' relatives. The food delivery rider would then request payment from the debtors or recipients of the orders, said SPF.

> 

> ""Those who deliberately cause annoyance and disruption to public sense of safety, peace and security will be arrested and dealt with severely in accordance with the law,"" the police said then.

SmirkingImperialist,"Uber, Grab, and all of their variants are basically running on a bubble created by *unconventional* monetary policy: Quantitative Easing by the USA's Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan or Negative Interest rate by the European Central Bank. There is basically so much practically zero interest loans on the market today that companies that haven't make a cent of profit still remain solvent. This is not unusual, for example, Airbus ran on a loss for decades chipping away Boeing market share; it could do this because France and Germany considered civilian airframe design and manufacturing to be important enough of a strategic concern that they use government funding to keep Airbus afloat. What exactly is the strategic asset of Uber and Grab for the US government?

In practice, this means a transfer of money from savers (in the regime of negative interest rate your money evaporate at the negative rate + inflation rate) to investors, which Central Bankers worldwide hope will trickle down to workers, which in all honesty, do; though in a rather inefficient manner.

Historical records showed that this is a bad idea. US Federal Reserve basically announced recently that they will go pedal to the metal with the money printing, consequences be damned. Their reasoning is simple: typically, they expect inflation to rise and employment rate will fall, but since neither has happened, they will continue. Somehow, their mandate also include improving the issue of gender and racial equality. *But*, we can be in a brave new world where this may work, somehow.",2021-01-24 08:25:21,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/l38wf2/rant_foodpandas_customer_service_is_a_terrible/

SmirkingImperialist,">Except that we’ve just experienced the greatest bull run in the history of the world?  And GME popped on Friday because the Fed has been pushing down interest rates?

Exactly. Central Banks made money really cheap, bought up shares, stocks, and assets and push their prices up. The bull run has everything to do with their policy and nothing to do with any fundamentals. One adage of investment has been ""time in the market beats timing the market"" and ""the stock market will go up in the long run"". The long-term price movement of stocks and assets since 2008 or so has everything to do with Central Banks' balance sheet.

Retail investors can indeed speculate and drive very short-term movements but in the long run, it's up to the Central banks.

>institutional investor climate

When an institutional investor, and the biggest owners are Central Banks, it's impossible that they don't affect stock prices in anyway. Of course they do. Same issue with passive and index funds. Their assumptions that their actions will have negligible effects on the price is OK when they are small but once they go to dominate the market, it's impossible that their actions isn't affecting the market. Central Banks couldn't push trillions worth of liquidity into the market without driving up prices. Economics fundamentals and company performance has nothing to do with stock price anymore.

Orthodox economics is in the post-realism realm: their predictions and theories have no relation with reality. They couldn't predict shit. So why bother studying it?",2021-01-24 13:19:58,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/l38wf2/rant_foodpandas_customer_service_is_a_terrible/
SGtraderpro,"> The bull run has everything to do with their policy and nothing to do with any fundamentals

Except that many of the stocks are still not recovered from pre Covid levels, and most that are up are just the safe stocks like FAANG or sectors that managed to profit during Covid?  Companies like PDD, BABA, AMZN, JMIA (e commerce), freelancing companies, digital payment services (e.g. PYPL, SQ, SE) are up (4x) because of government FP or MP? Really bruh?  It’s nothing to do with fundamentals?   

Macroeconomics play a big part in finance, but not the way you think.  It’s not the Fed or Central banks that is pushing stocks up, it’s the way the stock favourites have changed in a new Covid era.  Most stocks, as I’ve said, are still not recovered and not profiting off Covid.  The bull market, which I called a market, just actually refers to specific sectors and  firms.

> orthodox economics... couldn’t predict shit

This is your only point that I partially agree with, but I would like to point out that the reality that most people refuse to acknowledge is that most economics you learn in university is useless.  It’s too much theory and modelling and too little application on any side.  The economics academia scene in SG is pretty disappointing imho. 

It is also ironic that you think economic fundamentals and company performance has nothing to do with stock price, when your approach of what economic fundamentals is is wrong in the first place.  The economic fundamentals in a Covid era has benefitted some winners and chose some losers.  It’s as common sense as that and the only reason why you cannot see this is because of the bullshit education system and how it obfuscates everything with theoretical economics.",2021-01-24 14:14:09,-1,,,/r/singapore/comments/l38wf2/rant_foodpandas_customer_service_is_a_terrible/

Deliveroo has, more than once, not delivered orders because they could not find riders. They just kept changing the estimated arrival time until we cancelled (I’m talking teatime stuff for office ordered at 2pm that hasn’t arrived after 4pm and they still have no rider).

Foodpanda makes it insanely difficult to find the help chat, and then they go in these logical loops and keep doing stupid shit. Shit so stupid i was convinced the guy on the other side was a bot. And every time we disconnected because my screen locked while waiting for a reply, I got a new dumbass and had to repeat myself over and over. I usually only get a refund after I’ve wasted more than an hour. (Eg Foodpanda placed an order at a restaurant that was closed and replaced by a totally different restaurant, this was discovered by my rider who went to pick up the order and realised there was no such shop, and the customer service guy assured me my order would be delivered, called the rider and told him to go back, and called the ex employee of the restaurant and told him to prepare the order. When the rider called me back again I had to repeat my story. Took nearly 2 hours on the phone to get my $30 back). But they are often cheaper than grab.

Grab was only good because they had vouchers that drove down the cost of delivery. Once the vouchers are gone probably won’t use it except for self pickup.",2020-11-30 19:52:28,8,,,/r/singapore/comments/k3qqvp/customer_service_deliveroo_vs_foodpanda_vs_grab/

App set delivery to location A (approx 1km away) but comments input delivery to location B (approx 10km away) for a fare of $5. And I'm riding a bicycle, no way was I gonna cycle 10km.

Don't think mine was a glitch but a mistake on the customer's end. Called Grab support and they told me to deliver to location A even when I knew the customer (which I had also contacted to confirm delivery location) was at location B. I went through the standard motion, wait 5-10 min and disposed of the food.

Another Grab support staff did call me when I was already at location A and said the customer called and asked if I could return the food back to the restaurant while Grab re-assigns the delivery to a motorcyclist. 

Funny how they didn't try to resolve that when I was still at the restaurant and on the line with Grab support. They didn't want to compensate me for making another trip back so yea I rejected it.

&#x200B;

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Foodpanda deliveryman in Bukit Panjang receives order to pick up at Hougang for S$5

> One Foodpanda delivery rider recently received a rather perplexing order — at Hougang, even though he was at Bukit Panjang.

> Order pick up 20km away

> Speaking to Mothership, Dylan Chen explained that he rides a bicycle and is typically stationed in the west side of Singapore.

> He was however, ""unfortunate"" enough to be selected by Foodpanda to do a ""cycling marathon"".

> Chen received an order of fish soup that he had to deliver to a customer at Bukit Panjang Ring Rd.

> However the food was to be picked up at Hougang Ave 4, roughly 20km away from his location.

> The app stated that he would earn S$5 from the assignment.

> Chen then tried to contact Foodpanda's customer service.

> After apologising for the inconvenience caused, the customer service staff stated that Chen would have to carry out the order as he had already accepted it.

> This is despite the fact that Chen revealed he was riding a bicycle.

> The staff continued to insist that it was part of standard operating procedure.

> Chen said that following this exchange, the chat was closed.

> Left with no choice, he decided to re-dispatch the order on the chance that other riders nearer to Hougang would pick up the order.

> This he said, caused the customer to ""wait till no end"", and also impacted his record with Foodpanda.

> Chen said that riders who re-dispatch their orders can have their Batch level affected. Batches will determine riders' shift bookings, among other things.

> He also believes that she did not end up receiving her order.

> Thankfully though, he said that his Batch level was not affected after this incident.

> Mothership has reached out to Foodpanda for more information, and will update the story when they reply.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

aviationlad,"Fuck FP's treatment of the riders. Two weeks ago there was an unannounced earnings cut of about 60 cents + 70 cents per order. That adds up a lot. After the earnings cut, Foodpanda is officially the worst paying food delivery service for riders. There is literally no upside of working for Foodpanda compared to Grab now.

When its raining, no choice but to do if you have a shift that day.

The app also glitches a lot. Just like in this post. Sometimes when offered a delivery, the app doesn't even show the riders the food pick up point and destination the rider decides whether to decline or accept the order. 

In addition, if you got book shift, sometimes they suka suka just remove your shift and give it to another rider.

Ever since FP opened up more shifts and dropped earnings as you said, it's not worth the time. While Grab has a lot more riders in comparison, the bar for getting incentives is much lower compared to FP and you have a 10% buffer for acceptance/cancellation respectively, so there's more room for error compared to FP, where we're not even allowed to make 1 mistake and have to hit over a certain number of relative hours to hit Batch 1

While not insignificant, it was not a very substantial amount either,” the judge added in explaining why he imposed a sentence lower than what the prosecution sought.

Wow. I'm curious how long the prosecution was asking for a S$2285 cheating case.

nicktanisok,"Speaking as someone who delivers on weekend with panda as well as someone who uses it - Their CS is the worst experience I've ever faced.

It does not help that their CS/support team do not appear to be local - this is important as they are unable to relate to the riders frustrations on location bugs (east side pin deliver west side etc.) on the app.

Never in my life have I faced support that actively try to not support you. They need an entire overhaul ASAP. My GF faced the email/phone number decoupling issue also - till this date not resolved (raised ticket Jan - attempted multiple times just for them to say check the email when the email cannot be accessed anymore).

They are either blind, unable to comprehend English, or actively sabotaging the company as long as the ticket appears to be an issue that cannot be resolved within 5 mins.

peacedout933,"The problem is not with technology but how you implement it and care about your user’s experience. 

They probably have removed your email from the account attached to your old number. 
This happens when they allow user to login or create a new account with just mobile and OTP verification with some rules to validate if it’s actually you.

The user who has your old number must have already taken over ur account and your email is overwritten. 

This is one of the pitfalls of using mobile number as the only unique identifier of accounts. Especially for Singapore where we have recycled mobile numbers. 

They should have simply created a new account and replaced your old account with a dummy mobile number so that your account can still be recoverable by you via email.

Medicube,"Here to shed some light on what happens on the other end as the agent. Long read ahead so be warned. Or just skip to the end for the tl;dr.

To set the record straight, I have NEVER worked for FoodPanda so it’s not like I’m trying to defend the company. Just here to share my experiences ◡̈ 

Having worked on the other side of the line as a CS agent, agents aren’t allowed to freely dispense info and generally have template answers to follow. If you deviate from it, you could get in trouble as many times there are things that the company doesn’t want the customer to know. During training the company will usually dictate the type of tone that you’re supposed to use as it reflects the image that the company wants to portray to the user. These days, there’s been a shift towards a friendlier, less formal tone (complete with use of emojis). Not sure why but probably to cater to a younger audience.

Also, queries that go beyond simple generic questions have to be escalated to the relevant internal teams and these teams more often than not, don’t care about the customer as it’s not their job to appease them. So CS agents often find themselves stuck, being unable to help as they don’t have the info needed to solve the customer’s query. All they can do is wait for the internal departments to get back to them. And in the meantime, the longer the customer waits, the angrier they get. But the other internal teams typically only work during office hours. Which means that weekend queries have to be put on hold until Monday, earliest.

But at the same time the CS agent is also the one having to deal with the customer’s wrath. CS agents don’t get paid enough for whatever sh*t storm customers throw at them throughout the day. The ratio of agents to customer queries can be anywhere from 1:10 if its a small company, to about 1:5,000 if its a big one. There are only so many hours in a day and only so much that the CS agent can do.

Some agents who have been doing this for a long time just stop caring. Because there is just no point. The customer will forever be angry and the company will forever refuse to admit that their practices are subpar. I’m not saying this should excuse agents from showing a bad attitude to customers. I have definitely seen agents who can’t be bothered and are just doing the job for some simple pocket change.

TL;DR CS agents are also just people who are trying to do their jobs at the end of the day. There’s only very little they can do beyond handling simple generic queries cos they really only have access to very basic information. Don’t get mad at them if they have to ding dong your query to other teams. They have to ding dong it to even get some form of answer to tell the customer 🤷🏻‍♀️

For example, $100 meal that’s 55% off costs like $47.78. It’s not even GST. Or applying discount before GST and adding GST back. Nope.

And the customer support will reply that there are no calculation errors.

They switched to dynamic pricing (a la grab) a few months ago - you will commonly see delivery fees that used to be really cheap (50c-1.99) - this lasted for like 2-3 weeks.

Obviously they notice that their profits were taking a dip and re-scaled their pricing algorithm  (they are not transparent on this) so much so that now even the 2km places are 2.99 in price when they would have been 50c in the past.

It makes me so worked up because why you gotta cheat my tender feelings like that /s? Did they think their customers were too dumb or too blind to notice? Just display what's being charged.

WellOkayMaybe,"These guys are amazing humans. 

Used to work for Deliveroo as a rider ops manager for a while. Everyone there from CEO down has to do at least one slot of deliveries a month to stay connected to how hard the delivery rider's job is. 

Happy to see you giving credit when it's due!

The gig economy is hard, but it can be rewarding if you play it right. There is nothing wrong, shitty, or demeaning with being a delivery rider long-term - any more than it is to be a construction worker, toilet cleaner or do any honest job to support yourself and family. 

Your slightly Dickensian reference to ""station"" in society only confirms what we know - we in Singapore are classist and status obsessed. But really, as long as you can pay for your essentials, your job does not define who you are. I learned that the hard way, when facing an identity crisis after losing a job several years ago.

The question isn't whether the rider will rise in society. Social trajectories aren't assuredly upwards. Question is -  would you be able to be to go ""backwards"" and do those waitering/delivery jobs today, without changing who you are or being ashamed, if things took a bad turn?",2020-09-27 07:35:52,190,,,/r/singapore/comments/j086xn/ode_to_foodpanda_guy/

Regarding you calling me out with Dickens, I snorted into my coffee this morning laughing. Such a spot on description of my overwrought turn of phrase. And I _hate_ Dickens, with his ponderous and depressing writing. But, I wrote it, I'll own it. 

I very much went backwards before, during, and after the CB. I'm self employed with my own business that relies upon people being able to get together in groups. For almost four months I earned next to nothing -like around $250 a month. Terrifying. 

Would I do a job that I hated to survive? Absolutely. Would I be ashamed? No. Would I be ok with having such a large part of my day devoted towards something that didn't fulfill me, definitely not. 

I guess what I meant to say has to do with fulfillment as a human being. If someone looks forward to delivering food and that's what they do for the majority of their day, then they are far ahead of a lot of people.

AsiaOne: Improve your order success rate, Foodpanda tells customer seeking refund.
http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/improve-your-order-success-rate-foodpanda-tells-customer-seeking-refund

What's interesting is this:

>This isn't the first time that Foodpanda's self-improvement advice to customers was not taken well.

>In May, another customer complained that he was denied a refund and was also told to improve his order success rates after reportedly receiving three defective orders within a single week.

>However, in a subsequent email, the Foodpanda customer care team appeared to admit that the missing order was a result of ""heavy load of orders"" at the restaurant in question and granted him a refund in what they called a ""one-time exemption"".

In short, though FoodPanda has less gaffes than Grab, it seems that it does have its controversies.",2020-08-31 22:30:32,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/ijcojx/got_this_rude_and_ridiculous_email_from/

jmzyn,"I’m a PT food delivery rider and I see customers’ typical delivery fees ranging from $3-$4.50 and GrabFood topping up $0.50-$1.50.

Can I ask how much north your fees have climbed up? Because the delivery guys’ earnings have been going south. 

Also, GrabFood has recently forced assigned its riders to deliver more orders per trip (going to 2-3 restaurants and delivering to 2-3 customers) which equates to even less payout on their part to the rider. They say it’s for riders to plan their trip better which we all know is complete BS. 

So if you’re customer2 and ordered from just 3 streets away, you could get your food over an hour later. Worst scenario: their allocation algorithm is random and they assigned your job to a rider 20 streets away from the restaurant. Poor rider is also assigned another order to collect and deliver before delivering to you. Just so happens restaurant1 came up with a promo and are short handed and only starts cooking when the rider reaches. So he rides for 15mins to the restaurant and waits another 30mins, then goes to restaurant2. thankfully your food is already ready but has gone all cold! He then proceeds to deliver to customer1 which takes another 10mins before finally delivering to you.

So we get an angry customer who got their food cold and late. A tired rider who had to go 2 different locations far-away. A restaurant who still complains about the commission rates even as their promo is selling but their reputation is hurt because the food is cold.

Oh, I haven’t taken into account the weather and road conditions, customers who just can’t answer the door and expect to be called. Customers living in condos who take forever to answer the intercom, condo management that wants your rider to park outside and walk all the way in.

Can’t fault you for wanting to pay in cash but the least you could do is pay in exact and not flash that $50 note for a $10+ meal. As for incomplete delivery, that’s a sticky situation.",2020-08-31 09:14:14,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/ijcojx/got_this_rude_and_ridiculous_email_from/

How often do customers tip? Does the customer’s rating of the driver or tips to the driver have any influence ( E.g. on the order allocation or the commission to the driver ) ?",2020-08-31 10:28:15,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/ijcojx/got_this_rude_and_ridiculous_email_from/
jmzyn,"you should ask yourself how often do you tip? There is absolutely nothing wrong with not tipping because it's ingrained in our local culture. I personally do not tip unless I felt the service rendered deserves it but more often than not, the overall customer's experience is soured due to little/no fault of the rider. So no tip ultimately. Ha!

As earlier highlighted, slow delivery even though its 3 streets away, missing food items due to restaurant missing out. I once traveled back because the restaurant called AFTER I had delivered the item. (the customer must have called to check where the drinks were) 

So that's 10mins to and 10mins fro to get something that was missed out. When I went back, the restaurant still had the cheek to say they put it there and I didn't take when I was all along waiting and when they called, they handed the bag to me and that was it. You may argue, you should at least check the drinks but sometimes fatigue sets in, you'll just take whatever order number and go. 

so in total 20 mins wasted. Did I expect to get a tip for going 2 rounds, yes. Was I tipped, no. Anyway, thinking back, I did not have to fulfill the missing order because I was already assigned a new order after my 1st trip. Usually, GrabFood would have settled it with the customer. But I guess there has been rampant abuse. And we all know getting to support hotline even as a customer is terrible.

Finally, to answer your question, full amount of tip goes to the rider. So ratings do not matter. Grab's rating system is flawed because I never got to see the bad ratings given and usually they are written off unless it is something very serious. So, as of now, I'm still a 5-star unblemished rider. Haha.

And less than 5% of customers tip (at least for me). so that's 1 tip of maybe loose change to $1-$3 out of 25 trips made. 

**Pathetic is an understatement.**

So yes. some of you should validate what they meant by **delivery fee** keeps rising or do they mean overall marked up food prices? I personally would not pay $4 delivery fee for a single $6 McD ($5 dine in) filet meal .

yeeez1,"Ok I did some math and here's what I got:

The discount is applied on the pre-GST undiscounted price, but GST is charged based on the discounted price that you first see on the menu.

So in your case, the GST is charged on 13.93 (which is the subtotal shown on the menu screen), but the discount value is (19.9/1.07) * 30% = 5.58

For some odd reason, they're then using the pre-GST discount value and deducting it from the post-GST original price to achieve your final payable amount (in this case, 19.90 being the post-GST original price). 19.90 - 5.58 = 14.32 which is what you're seeing (it is hella weird tho).

EDIT: the 19.90 total you see on the payment screen is already inclusive of GST.",2020-10-14 18:22:42,21,,,/r/singapore/comments/jaw985/foodpanda_overcharging/

> SINGAPORE: Over almost three weeks, a 27-year-old man ordered more than S$700 worth of meals from food delivery applications, had them delivered to his neighbours' flats and ate them without making payment.

> For four counts of cheating, with an additional nine charges taken into consideration, Leonard Tan Tong Han was sentenced to seven days' jail on Thursday (Sep 17).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Tan stayed in a 14th-floor flat in Choa Chu Kang, and carried out the deception by having food delivered to his neighbours' flats on the floors just above and below his.

> The court heard that Tan made several food orders on the GrabFood and Foodpanda mobile applications between Feb 25 and Mar 14, with no intention of paying for his orders.

> He selected the ""cash on delivery"" payment option while ordering and before the food arrived, sent messages to the delivery riders telling them to leave the food outside the flat. He also told them he would make payment via PayLah! or PayNow.

> When he saw that the food had arrived, he would go to his neighbours' flats and collect the food from outside the flats. However, he did not make payment for the orders.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> To carry out his scheme, Tan set up multiple accounts on the food delivery apps with fictitious names and random phone numbers so that he could not be subsequently contacted.

> In one of the incidents on Mar 8, Tan ordered food from a restaurant in Gangsa Road via the Foodpanda app, under the fake name ""Sammy Leong"".

> He selected the ""cash on delivery"" option for the S$91.59 order, which he arranged to be delivered to his neighbour's flat on the 13th floor.

> In his order remarks on the application, Tan wrote: ""Leave food above shoe rack ... picking kids up from hospital. Just sms me your paynow number I will paynow and whatsapp you.""

> The delivery rider placed the food on the shoe rack outside Tan's neighbour's flat, sent a photo of the delivery to a number Tan had given him and left.

> DELIVERY RIDER SENSED SOMETHING WAS AMISS

> Tan later picked up the food, but the food delivery rider sensed something was amiss when he received no reply to his photo. He returned to the flat and saw that the food was gone.

> The rider knocked on the door of the flat, but the neighbour told him he had not placed any food delivery orders, adding that there had been similar incidents.

> The rider reported the case to Foodpanda. The neighbour had filed a police report earlier on Feb 25, over two pizza delivery orders that had been sent to his home.

> The total losses sustained by GrabFood and Foodpanda came to S$718.54. Tan has repaid the companies in full.

> The judge allowed Tan to serve his sentence on Oct 1.

> For each charge of cheating, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined or both.

Unfortunately most of the theft and cheating crimes in the Penal Code are property-centric, i.e. they deal with property and not services

Wage theft would not easily fall under those defined offenses in the Penal Code.

There is a regulatory regime under our labour laws, i.e. Employment Act and Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, but MOM enforcement is spotty. It's no secret where our enforcement priorities lies, and it's also no secret that Singapore treats and has long treated migrant workers shabbily.

There is an excellent position paper by HOME about the practice of wage theft and wage exploitation in Singapore - easily googleable. This issue is also somewhat of interest to me, i  volunteered at a migrant worker NGO for a while and witnessed many outrageous/exploitative practices esp by construction companies.",2020-09-18 09:59:44,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/iugpjo/man_gets_jail_for_ordering_more_than_s700_worth/

HollyGlen,"Ok, so the next time one is ""under police investigation"", your employer is entitled to lock you up for 40 days with only fear of a fine. Got it.

It also seems very funny / fishy that:

AureBesh123,"Actually i stand corrected. There's a new section 420A([https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr420A-#pr420A-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr420A-#pr420A-)) in the Penal Code which criminalizes fraudulently or dishonestly obtaining services.

This was just amended last year and came into effect in Jan 2020 this year, which does underscore the point that historically, the law was far more concerned about protecting people's property rights (whether tangible or intangible) rather than being cheated of services.

But i think your larger question is what separates a breach of contract (which would result in a civil claim) from a cheating offence (which would result in criminal prosecution).

The mental element of proving fraud or deception is a necessary element for the offence. This is a very high threshold to prove in reality.

In this Grabfood case, the fraudulent and deceptive conduct is clearly borne out, and his intent can be readily inferred from his numerous pattern of past orders.

A one-off failure to pay your SGH medical bill is not likely enough to plausibly give rise to an inference of fraud.

From an enforcement point of view, the police and prosecutors aren't going to sieve through the hundreds of dishonoured transactions everyday to see whether they have a basis of charging someone for an offence or not.",2020-09-18 13:53:01,0,,,/r/singapore/comments/iugpjo/man_gets_jail_for_ordering_more_than_s700_worth/

Deliveroo is the most reliable of the 3 in terms of driver availability and non cancellations. Pretty good with service too, got no question refunds when items missing. Only con of deliveroo is that selection is smaller than grab.


Grab has the best restaurants selection of the 3, but not being able to find a rider and rider cancellation is fairly common. Service is decent

I had a problem last month with one of my vouchers — every time I email in (since live chat only works if there's an order placed), I get someone else, and I would have to explain my issue again. One CSO even gave me a voucher code that expired _two weeks before_ my email.

I believe their Facebook page is manned by more competent people (but still facepalm-level). You can try posting a comment to one of their posts, and hopefully they'll ask for your ticket number and take a look at it.

My issue hasn't been resolved, but I pretty much gave up. Some of Foodpanda's promos are good, but their service recovery is a _huge_ waste of time if things go wrong.

Echlori,"Never had a good experience with them.

1. Ordered pizza in with colleagues, and despite the restaurant saying that our order was ready, the rider never turned up. Since it was near enough, my boss drove out and collected it instead. Rider never ever showed up.
2. A couple of years, later, thought they might have improved and gave them a second chance. Ordered in pizza (again!), got a call from the restaurant directly to ask me if I wanted to change an item which was OOS, which I did. Food came, I thanked the rider and thought wow, they are ok this time round, only to discover a missing item (not the aforementioned earlier). Called back the outlet and they never picked up, and ended up having to haggle with CS. Got a $5 voucher but never used it as I gave up on Foodpanda.

Could just be probability but I've never ran into such issues with their competitors.",2020-08-25 10:14:15,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/

Once, I ordered food and was waiting patiently for an hour only to realise the bloody rider had marked it as delivered when he CLEARLY didn't deliver. Contacted the useless CS only for them to tell me to wait patiently for half an hour more and to check outside my door (which I checked) and they only agreed to a refund after I started scolding them. It's fucking crazy how they don't believe what you say when they tried calling the fucking rider and couldn't reach him (not one, but two of the staffs). Refund takes forever to be processed as well.

clownykillaa,"Foodpanda is the worst. There was once my order arrived 3 hours late and there was no way of tracking the location of the driver or any way to directly contact the driver. When the food finally arrived, the driver said it’s an app issue. Food panda said it could be due to various reasons, such as delays by the driver. They offered to give me a 5% discount code for my trouble, which is obviously ridiculous. We’ve already cooked instant noodles by then, and the food is obviously in questionable condition if it was a delay by the driver. It was only when I brought up food safety violations did they reply IMMEDIATELY and issued an immediate refund.",2020-08-25 18:55:28,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/

But today I just had a shitty experience where the rider placed my food at the WRONG GATE. He placed it at my neighbour’s door instead and I went to the help centre to check if it was rly mine or not. And instead of helping..... The customer service just told me to keep checking outside my door when I said multiple times I don’t see it there and I even took a pic of my neighbour’s door and asked if that is where he hung the food. 

Eventually they checked and said ya he hung it on the wrong gate. Told me to check and then didn’t even apologise what the fuck. So done.",2020-08-25 22:26:45,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/
Ansheilm,"I once ordered minced meat noodles and requested for sambal chilli.  
This is one of those dishes that I don't enjoy without the chilli.  
To me, eating minced meat noodles with no chilli is like eating steak well done without any salt, pepper or sauces.

Anyways, first order: no chilli.

Called up foodpanda CS and offered to make a second order immediately just so that they can bring the second order with enough chilli for both orders.

foodpanda CS assured me that he will make sure the next order went well but terminates the chat as I was making the order.

Food came with no chilli again. I rejected the order.

foodpanda CS refuses to refund either of my orders.

Only after unleashing my inner Ken did I get $10 vouchers.

I found out later that the foodpanda rider gave the second order to the security guard.

\---

How did Deliveroo handle this similar situation?

The Deliveroo CS told me where I could find the restaurant's contact number and advised me to contact the restaurant if I have any dietary requirements.

No issues with my orders ever since.

Mee siam mai hum?

No problem, just call the restaurant, tell the restaurant my order number and my request.

EDIT:  
Why the downvote? 

It's not like I asked foodpanda to just deliver the chilli in itself.   
I offered and actually ordered the 2nd set just so that they can rectify the mistake.  
AND the foodpanda CS did assure me that the will get the next order right and so I expect him to keep his word, which he didn't.",2020-08-24 22:13:08,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/

Dear,

Thank you for choosing foodpanda.

foodpanda doesn't settle for anything short of perfection when it comes to delivering satisfaction to customers like you, so such a mistake is not something we can look past. I am sorry to hear that your cooking instructions for order gxxo-2xx1 with Cold Stone Creamery (The Gardens Mall) was not followed.

This is indeed not the type of experience we strive for. There can be unusual situations, which are contrary to the expectations. We hope that your next experience with us would be a good one.

We don't like average. We will get better. Promise!

For further inquiries, please feel free to reach out to us via Help Center. You can count on us 24/7.

We love our customers and would like to see you back soon. 🐼❤️

I tried to fight for that because its pointless to do the 2 dollars refund if they are going to charge me 4.5... she refused so hard and I feel like im just wasting my time so I just hang up... I dont think its worth another 30 minutes just to even fight for that amount...

But let me get this straight.

foopanda provide a special request but customer cannot use it?

Minced meat noodles usually have the option of sambal chilli and vinegar but now the customer cannot ask for it?  
Btw, they updated the menu to have those options now so I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one requesting for it. 

foodpanda did not keep their word and I can't oppose that?  
If I cannot ask for the sambal chilli, foodpanda should just say it upright instead of agreeing for me to make the second order and promising that it will be righted.

Yeah, the vendor is the problem, but so is the foodpanda CS. 

Can, say can. Cannot, say cannot. 

Don't promise something then don't deliver.

ThatBurnerAcc,"A rider who says he can't see the message, is either lying or the facing some app problems.

When you order something thru the FP app, you can press the chat to message the rider. The rider HAS to reply a customer message before he can proceed with anything (pressing pick up/seeing address/pressing delivered)

In doing so, you will also be able to see the Rider's name from your notification bar.

IF rider decides to play punk, you have your order number and riders name.

Customers aren't the only one facing customer support issues. Us riders have our fair share of problems from Cx, vendor and support.",2020-08-25 15:41:03,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/

The only clue is the brief heads up notification that I saw before tapping it, but I won't know the full message. Feedback countless times but nothing changed. 

So don't rely too much on the rider chat. If you want a foolproof way to get your message across to the rider, before you place your order, add it in the ""notes to rider"" in your address section. It will definitely show up on our app. But remember to clear it for the future orders.

sneakpeek_bot,"> # S'pore teen, 17, arrested for allegedly cheating Foodpanda of S$14,000 by making fraudulent refund claims

> A 17-year-old male in Singapore has been arrested for his suspected involvement in cheating Foodpanda.

> He allegedly swindled more than S$14,000 from the food delivery company.

> Foodpanda made a police report on Aug. 21, after they were reportedly deceived into processing refunds for the customer.

> The latter had allegedly lied about not receiving his orders, claiming that the riders did not deliver them.

> Officers from Jurong Police Division arrested the teenager on Aug. 24.

> Preliminary investigations revealed that he had made S$14,000 worth of fraudulent refund claims on his delivery orders, which included cooked food, groceries, and liquor.

RedScimmy,"Alright this is gonna be pretty long.

In foodpanda, we have a tier ranking (1 to 6) which is determined by:

1. Your planned working hours vs actual working hours
2. Acceptance rate
3. Number of late logins
4. Attendance rate (whether you showed up for your shift or not)
5. Number of hours worked during weekend 'crunch time' (6.30pm to 10pm)

The first issue i encountered with them was the extremely slow delivering of the thermal bag. They promised it will be delivered within the week, but it just never came. I kept texting them when it would arrive and they kept saying that 'it has been scheduled to deliver'.

It's extremely frustrating because there is a refer-a-friend program where if you hit a quota within the month, your friend gets some incentives. The moment they open an account for you the deadline starts already (not when you begin your first delivery), and yet the bag doesn't reach me until like 2 weeks later?

How do you expect me to deliver without the thermal bag? It was extremely unsafe to ride because i had to hang the food on my handlebar and sometimes the order was HUGE so it was really difficult. I had to ride slowly to prevent the food from spilling and by the time i reached, the food was cold already.

Secondly, we riders also have a 'live chat system' which we can use when we encounter problems. But this live chat system is slow, inefficient and almost useless.

So there were a few times after sending an order and i'm taking the lift back down, apparently I received an order. However i didn't 'accept the order' because i didn't receive any notification because i was in the lift and there wasn't any signal. Once i reached the bottom the app says that I've been forced to put on break (means i can't receive any orders) for around 2 minutes because I didn't accept the order within a certain time.

I immediately contacted the live chat and told them the situation, where i was in the lift and there wasn't any signal that's why i couldn't accept the order. The live chat guy replied so slowly that my 'forced break' had already ended. I asked the him if this will affect my acceptance rate and he replied and i quote, ""no idea about that"".

This happened a few times where i didn't hear the notification bell because for some reason. Sometimes there's a notification bell and sometimes there isn't. It's really weird and frustrating. There's no double prompt and anything, and if you don't accept within like a minute you'll simply be forced to be put on break.

Most of the time when i tried to contact the live chat for help, before help came i managed to solve the problem myself already.

Lastly, the tier ranking affects how much you get paid. If you're in 1st tier, you get paid the highest and if you're in the last tier, you get paid the lowest. Foodpanda will update the riders' tier every week.

So just this week there was a huge commotion about the tier ranking because many of us riders did our best and diligently performed our duties (refer to the list above), but many of our tiers dropped suddenly.

Foodpanda comes in and say that 'there was a glitch and they will work to solve it as soon as possible', and after like 10 hours they 'finally solved the glitch'. But our tier ranking had all stayed the same, and they gave some bullshit excuses to explain how they calculated our ""new tier ranking"".

Needless to say everybody was really upset and there's honestly nothing we could do. There are some riders with almost 100% for everything, but was placed in tier 3.

If you ask me honestly, i *assume* it's a very discreet way of decreasing everybody's pay because there's higher demand of food delivery during the CB period and this was an unscrupulous way to cut their costs to gain higher profit. **BUT I'M JUST THROWING WILD GUESSES SO DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT.**

I guess that's the few main reasons why i feel so pekcek working for foodpanda. There are still many other little reasons but i don't want to nitpick.

jmzyn,"thank you for the insights, fellow rider. I'm from green and have my fair share of such bs.

It sucks that these companies don't invest much into customer service for their customers, let alone rider partners. Maybe they think in this age, there is no such thing as customer loyalty so there is no need to retain customers and that these pool of people have no choice but to use them. I think we already see that with the emergence of MVNOs... Focus on the bigger picture, get more merchants on board and the customers will come in eventually.

I really hope it will come back to haunt them someday.

On the whole, i suppose GrabFood's customer service to their food customers is better. I think they have been dishing out compensations more generously with little questions asked. (delivery partners bear the brunt of getting warnings and suspension...) Also, at least they don't add stupid pun problems like asking them to solve riddles. The problem is getting to them via their hotline. oh well!

I think they will all eventually die like BikeSharing if all these continue to go unregulated.

Similarities in these ""tech"" startups - dishing out coupons, free rides.... gain customer traction... unregulated system, rampant abuse of system (fraudulent claims, riders not delivering orders....) - eventually sudden shutdown of operations. 

So better not buy into any of their subscription credit plans, even so, they have been removing them since they don't make money from it. Haha!",2020-05-29 11:20:06,13,,,/r/singapore/comments/gs889e/haha_foodpanda_still_likes_riddling_their_users/

There seems to be NO clear indication of the restaurants the free delivery applies too. It's so misleading.

jmzyn,"Wow $10 for 50 deliveries. A single delivery fee is usually >$3.
I can foresee the number of FP delivery riders jumping ship if this really kicks off.

FP just wants the customers and the commissions from them ordering food under their platform. I wonder if they are running into cash flow problems. 

That is not sustainable if there was no minimum spending. 
Example: A $13 total order, $10 goes back to the restaurant; $3 goes to FP for their operation costs. The rider? Probably $1 from it and 20cents ($10/50). Where is the rest of the money to pay the rider coming from? Haha.
I doubt anyone is gonna do the job for $2. I can feel the sugarcane squeezed thru the juicemachine.

Their CS really kinda sucks imo but nonetheless, their reply was that the free delivery should AUTO APPLY as long as you've met the Terms and Conditions (they kept emphasizing this). When I told them that I have already fulfilled the minimum spending, they said that it might be a technical issue, that they will take note of my concern and told me to contact them again if the issue persists and I am being charged for delivery. When I asked if I would get refunded if I'm charged, they didn't wanna commit to it and just said 'Kindly note you will be assisted accordingly.'

Was honestly so pissed off that I crafted a PDF doc with god knows how many screenshots of all their CS agents' contradictory replies and submitted it to CASE. Also filed a dispute with my bank. They've been changing the T&Cs as and when they like and even removed them completely from their website but luckily I saved a screenshot before that. 

It's annoying because I know many other PandaPro subscribers would just heck care if Food Panda refuses to refund their delivery fees and accept the bullshit explanation they were given. Hopefully my complaint will be able to get them to wake up their idea and do things the proper way lol.

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Foodpanda collaborates with ST Engineering on drone food delivery trials

> SINGAPORE: Can chickens fly? On Thursday, five packets of ayam penyet did, when food delivery service Foodpanda used a drone to deliver the popular fried chicken dish from the Marina South Pier to a ship located 3km offshore.

> 

> It was a welcome treat for seafarers aboard the POSH Bawean, a PACC Offshore Services Holding (POSH) vessel designated to support crew changes for cargo ships calling in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> This comes after Foodpanda signed an agreement with Singapore Technologies (ST) Engineering in March to use DroNet - ST Engineering’s drone network system - to test the delivery of “light food items” over distances of up to 3km.

> 

> The collaboration, dubbed PandaFly, aims to eventually see drones picking up and delivering orders to and from designated collection points islandwide, with one of Foodpanda’s 12,000 delivery riders completing the last mile of the delivery.

> 

> This is not the first time Foodpanda has experimented with the use of drones for deliveries - the Berlin-based food delivery giant first did so in Singapore in 2015.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Food delivery via drone is taking flight, with companies such as Uber and KFC experimenting with the use of the devices over the past year.

> 

> “The fundamental desire in doing delivery by drone for us is to increase the choice for customers,” said Foodpanda Singapore managing director Luc Andreani.

> 

> He noted that while delivering food from the city - where many eateries are located - to residents in the heartlands by motorcycle is possible, it would take too long, which would in turn affect the quality of the food.

> PandaFly would allow Foodpanda to do islandwide deliveries without sacrificing that, he added.

> While the initial technological investment would be pricey, Mr Andreani said customers will not have to contend with “crazy high delivery fees”.

> “The idea would be to keep delivery fees stable so customers don't feel any difference,” he said, adding that economies of scale meant that the greater use of drones would eventually translate to lower prices.

> He did not specify when drone food deliveries would be made more widely available.

> ""As with any big disruptive innovation, in the very early days it's more like an investment for us, with the objective of also making it economically viable in the future,"" said Mr Andreani.

> 

> ST Engineering's DrN-15L drone was used to deliver five packets of ayam penyet from the Marina South Pier to a vessel located 3km offshore. (Photo: Hanidah Amin)

> In February, ST Engineering announced it was collaborating with maritime group Wilhelmsen Ships Service on the development and testing of shore-to-ship drone deliveries in Singapore, which would allow the devices to be operated beyond the pilot's visual line of sight.

> 

> The company’s DrN-15L drone, which was used on Thursday, is able to lift up to 2kg, and fly at speeds of up to 15 metres per second, with a delivery radius of up to 5km.

> 

> Mr Teong Soo Soon, ST Engineering’s UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) business vice president said he expects to eventually see a network of pre-approved flight routes, where drones can be safely used for deliveries.

> 

> The use of drones would allow for deliveries to fly directly from one point to another in a straight line, bypassing traffic and other obstacles, allowing for speedier deliveries, he said.

> 

> While it is unlikely that drones will do deliveries directly to homes, Mr Teong expects that there will soon be a network of collection points where these drone can take off and land from.

> “I think it's a realistic expectation of what might come in the next few years,” he said.

> 

> Mr Danny Chong, general manager for POSH’s Centres of Excellence (Innovation), said the usage of drones is an area that the company is “actively studying” as part of its innovation roadmap.

> “There is still much work to be done to fully enable shore-to-ship delivery over longer haul distances,” he said.

> 

> “POSH will continue to work with suitable partners so as to bring a taste of home to our seafarers onboard in time to come.”

LuciferBiscuit,"Hi, restaurant with foodpanda self pick up experience here.

When an order times out, like in your example, the device on the restaurant side starts beeping with a ""order #xx has timed out""

When this happens, most vendors will then click on it and be asked to answer, is the item picked up, yes or no.

When no is picked, then vendor will have to give reason, customer no show, customer still waiting, customer left.

For my experience, when I pick ""customer no show"", the order is then automatically cancelled by the system. HOWEVER, that does not mean the customer cannot come collect the food, afterall, the food is still here, I already prepared, I got paid, customer already paid. The kumgong system from foodpanda is often an issue because they do alot of preset options with very little actual communications between parties.

Did you try to contact the restaurant to say you are on your way to collect the food despite the cancellation? Because sometimes it's not the vendor intention to cancel, he just responding to the app.",2020-05-10 22:14:06,56,,,/r/singapore/comments/gh1w8u/rant_bad_experience_with_foodpanda/

That said, I am curious as to what Foodpanda meant by “order cancelled”. So was the food prepared or not? 

If it was ready, it makes no sense to not let you collect it and let it go to waste. So what happened to the food? Did it just sit there going cold? The employee just dumped it? 

But if the order was never prepared, then the restaurant has lost nothing, so why should you pay anything? 

Something sounds wrong with the system. I think that even if you end up not getting your money back, you deserve an explanation in the very least on what happened to your food.",2020-05-10 22:21:26,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/gh1w8u/rant_bad_experience_with_foodpanda/

,Today I ordered a burger king bundle meal from them ard 6pm... Outlet was quite nearby stated as 1.2km... They apologised and said that due to covid situation order will be delayed... Their estimated time was 7.30pm which was just nice for breaking fast since its mothers day n mum arent suppose to cook today... 7.15pm and app shows restaurant is preparing my order and will arrive in 15 mins time... By 8pm it was showing the same thing so i msg rider and he apologised to me saying that he couldnt wait at the restaurant any longer n he is cancelling the order but couldnt get thru to despatch... So i figured it was just my luck and have to be more patient so by 8.30pm that app was still showing the same your order will arrive in 15mins bullshit... so i msg the new rider and he told me he is still waiting for food to be prepared... Ard 8.50pm he too apologized to me and says he will be cancelling the order coz he too is tired of waiting... Food havent prepared yet... So i tried to cancel my order and the online chat kept getting disconnect over n over again until about 9.30pm an operator apologised and told me order will be send in 15 mins... lol Wat irony... I told him i lost total confidence in their 15 mins time frame n want yo cancel order... Told me i will onli be refunded ard 5 working days or more depending on banks... Gave me a 5 bucks voucher n gave the same sorry for breaking ur heart bullshit... Family still havent properly eaten so I called grab n 20mins later same bundle meal from the same bk outlet was delivered by a pretty grab rider... Im going green frm now on... I think their system is much better in handling the volume of orders these days as they have a huge fleet of phv drivers to help with the orders...

The food was already cooked and waiting for you, the vendor indicated that you were not present within the time limit, and since you didn’t show up at all, the food ultimately went to waste. 

In this case, it seems ridiculous to set such a short time limit to collect your food. What’s done is done, and I suppose the only thing we can do is to learn from this.",2020-05-10 23:18:40,5,,,/r/singapore/comments/gh1w8u/rant_bad_experience_with_foodpanda/

,"Percentage based commission doesn’t make sense for the merchants. E.g let’s assume a 30% commission on a $10 order = $3 for Grab. But if the order is $100 then 25% commission = $25. Grab’s cost doesn’t change at all whether the order is $10 or $100 because it’s still one single rider doing the delivery, so what Grab is doing is losing money on the smaller orders in the hopes that they will have enough big orders to cover their losses. 

One solution is to move away from percentage based to a rate structure such as:
-	$X for orders $10 or below
-	$X*1.3 for orders between $10-$19.99
-	$X*1.6 for orders between $20-$29.99
and so on...

The main problem with delivery is that it’s always a value-losing proposition with small orders because of the disproportionately high percentage of cost to order value. At the same time, the majority of orders are small orders. This is not a problem that can be easily solved.",2020-05-09 10:08:55,-1,,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

They’ve also been adding more “along the way” jobs to delivery so the overall topup gets even lower. 2x typical $5/jobs suddenly becomes 1x $9/2jobs.

ngrenjie,"Your solution doesn’t seem that much different from a percentage-based commission structure. The cut is still based on the order amount. 

I agree with your analysis that smaller deliveries are not worth it, but look at it this way. Your delivery crew still have to be paid regardless of whether they are working or not. If you set the minimum order limit too high and too few people order, this means your manpower is seriously going under-utilised. 

One solution I can think of is if you can get customers to place their order way in advance, which may then give the company time to consolidate the orders and see how best to deploy their manpower. For example, perhaps the software could identify that 4 of the orders from say, Streats at BPP are going to families living in the same block. One driver could then be instructed to collect them all and deliver them all at one shot, rather than having 4 different people make 4 separate trips. 

This would mean that the company doesn’t need to hire as many delivery people, which may cut down on their costs.",2020-05-09 10:58:10,-1,,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

You would have thought, hey wow, one straight line... optimal!

So if you are the customer waiting at Somerset, good luck to you.

PS: it is their guideline to follow the sequence because you are supposed to update the app upon every collection, delivery action.

jdickey,"Yeah, you're right. Web design here seems stuck in the late 1990s, particularly with regard to language support (the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/ws/languages) are probably still the gold standard here).

I also basically agree that having scores of different delivery fleets is wasteful and a business opportunity in its own right. Maybe, if the bigs don't make their payment scheme more sustainable for the restos and ethical for the customers, an association of restaurateurs could organise a cost-neutral delivery system. Order from whatever restaurant you like, either through their app or the association's, and the association's delivery drivers will get your food to your door.

Advantages over the current system:

* Delivery as a cost-neutral (commercial non-profit) service;
* Lower prices to the customer, and the ability for individual restaurants to experiment with their own promotions more than is presently done; and, not least
* Money made here stays here, and isn't spent on servicing the (all international) bigs' debt.

Doing a multilingual Web/phone app with modern tooling isn't as hard as the way most Singapore sites go about it, and so having an independent, *fully local* site/app with broad visibility and uptake would be a much-needed wake-up call to cheap-at-any-cost Singaporean businesses' Web sites. (20 years' Web development speaking here; the local Web environment is positively *enraging* to anybody who knows anything about modern standards. A good site drives engagement; that first *g* should never be an *r* in a consumer-driven industry.)",2020-05-09 17:33:22,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

sneakpeek_bot,"> # foodpanda waives commissions for one month for Singapore hawkers new to app

> HAWKERS who newly get on board foodpanda will enjoy zero commission fees for one month, as part of a new initiative to ease hawkers’ entry onto the food delivery app, foodpanda announced in a press statement on Friday. 

> Dubbed the “pandasupport hawker initiative”, the incentive is being rolled out with “the understanding that commission fees are factored as a substantial barrier that is currently preventing hawkers from coming on board foodpanda”, the company said. 

> Food delivery apps have faced heat for charging steep commission fees of 30 to 40 per cent, eating into hawkers’ already-thin margins. foodpanda’s latest move comes as the food and beverage sector prepares for continued strain. Curbs on dining-in are set to continue past June 1, even as Singapore goes into the first phase of reopening the economy. 

> The pandasupport package is applicable to National Environment Agency (NEA) licensed hawkers as well as hawkers operating out of hawker centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators.

> The package also looks to support hawkers who are not eligible for the Food Delivery Booster package jointly launched with Enterprise Singapore in April. This includes self-employed hawkers that are not registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. 

> Under the pandasupport initiative, eligible hawkers will also be provided complimentary marketing support via a prime placement on the “Hawker Favourites” carousel tile in the app. This is prominently displayed at the top of the foodpanda app to amplify customer outreach.

> Separately, foodpanda will be donating perishable food items, such as fruits and bread, from its pandamart warehouses in Outram and Jurong West to migrant workers staying in private residential premises, in collaboration with non-profit organisation TWC2.

> “(As) Singapore prepares itself for the easing of 'circuit-breaker' measures, foodpanda remains mindful of various segments of our community that are more vulnerable to the impacts of Covid-19 such as hawkers and migrant workers. With the resources that we have, we hope to be able to make a sustained difference,” said Luc Andreani, managing director of foodpanda Singapore.

***Chicken Rice***   
In store Price: $3.50   
Grab food Price: $4.50

***Thai Wanton Noodles***  
In store Price: $5   
Grab Food Price $7.10

***Tuk Tuk Cha Noodles***   
In store Price: $8.90   
Grab Food Price: $10.20

It's so common that whether its officially or not, practically all stores do it, which passes on the fees charged by these delivery services down to the consumer.

Cylencer,"While I have all 3 apps, I'm usually only doing panda, especially during peak hours because imo it has the best rate of orders. 

But during the times when I don't have any shifts (have to book shifts on panda), I'll turn on grab and deliveroo at same time, and whichever gets orders first I'll accept that one and turn off the other one (for grab and deliveroo, you can go online/offline at anytime). Once I'm halfway to the customer's location then I will turn on the other one and accept any orders that come in. Or you could leave deliveroo always online and only accept if it is on the way (need to know your area well). Good thing about deliveroo is that you can reject orders unlimited times. Both panda and grab has penalties if you reject orders. 

However the reality is that most of the time, only grab will have consistent orders as deliveroo is quite dead in the heartlands.

planet__express,"There was once when I placed an order and the driver did not turn up to take the food. I called the restaurant directly, they said they'd been waiting an hour for the driver and they had been calling Foodpanda for the past hour, but FP kept telling them they'd send a new driver. In the end, the restaurant gave me the FP number to call directly.

I did so, and it was picked up within 3 rings by a live agent who sounded local. I could hear laughter and jokes in the background as I explained my issue. The agent turned hostile the moment I said I was a customer, and she said I wasn't supposed to have this number. I said the restaurant gave it to me because they didn't know what else to do, FP wasn't helping them.

The agent proceeded to inform her colleagues about this in another language, thinking I wouldn't understand her. (Joke's on her, I'm fluent in the language she's speaking). She then proceeds to say customers are all troublesome and a waste of their time, before keeping me on hold for 20 min. She finally came back to me and told me they would refund me.

I told her (in the language she'd used) that it's too bad customers are a waste of their time because we're the reason her company is in business. Cue uncomfortable silence before she pretended to be cut off and hung up on me.

I never got my $48 refund and I've never used Foodpanda since.

Edit: I should explain that I did try to go through the proper channels, via the live chat. However like OP, I was like the 180th customer in line and waited like a kumgong forever before I gave up and called the restaurant directly.",2019-08-03 12:09:57,219,,,/r/singapore/comments/cldz4j/rip_foodpanda_customer_support_no_need_to_pang/

So they are still charging the restaurants, just that they are taking their fee from “payment and delivery” rather than a percentage of sales. 

If you are a hawker or a small store, this is probably not suitable for you since you have to commit to an flat-rate upfront cost regardless of how much you actually sell on AirAsia’s platform, whereas on commission-based platforms you only pay a fee to the platform where you make a sale.",2021-02-18 16:24:38,12,,,/r/singapore/comments/lmg602/airasia_ceo_announces_entry_to_spores_food/

Just wondering... why are they using Malaysia as the case study? Foodpanda and Grabfood (previously ubereats) have been in SG for years now.

> A hardworking man in Singapore has been photographed with two food delivery bags on his bicycle:

> Advertisement

> Double the deliveries, double the pay

> His propensity for working double has won praise from commenters:

> Advertisement

> How much can he earn?

> Currently, three major food delivery services exist in Singapore: GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.

> All have different formulas for how much they pay their delivery personnel, but the figure comes up to about S$6 to S$11 per delivery on average.

> This is dependent on whether deliveries are made inside or outside of the Central Business District area and if it is during peak hours.

> Riders can make up to two deliveries per hour if both are shorter distance jobs.

> Advertisement

> What’s the strategy?

> Delivering for two services makes sense during non-peak hours.

> Rather than being limited by the job offers made available by one app, relying on both apps at the same time allows riders to strategise: Pick and choose jobs based on location, distance and familiarity with the area, among other factors.

> GrabFood pays a base of S$5 per trip, with riders earning up to S$6 to S$10.50 with surcharges depending on location and time.

> There are also incentives if trip targets are met.

> Foodpanda offers a basic hourly pay of about S$9 — or S$9.50 for those riding in the CBD.

> There is an additional S$4 commission for each weekday delivery and S$5 for weekend delivery.

> SINGAPORE - A Foodpanda delivery rider is being investigated by the police and his company for allegedly duping a customer into paying cash for her food order, though she had already paid the amount via Nets.

> Human resource executive Jasmine Tan, 30, shared her experience in a Facebook post on Thursday (July 4), saying that she had ordered food to be delivered to her Punggol home at 7.30pm the day before.

> She told The Straits Times over the phone on Friday that she noticed that her order from fast-food chain Popeyes was marked as delivered on the Foodpanda app at 7.45pm.

> However, the rider only arrived with the food about half an hour after that, limping and with a bandage on his knee.

> The rider, who looked to be a man in his 20s or 30s, claimed that his electric scooter was involved in a hit-and-run accident with a car near Oasis Primary School, and Ms Tan's order was damaged in the process.

> He added that he returned to Popeyes to reorder the food, which costs $34.09, and asked Ms Tan for cash, promising that Foodpanda would refund the amount to her in six days.

> Ms Tan told ST: ""He was stammering a lot when I saw him, but I thought it was because he had an accident. I didn't think that much of it, because my children were also very hungry from waiting for over an hour.""

> Related Story GrabFood deliveryman caught on camera grabbing towel outside HDB flat

> Related Story Grab investigating case of deliveryman caught on camera taking a pair of shoes

> She paid the man the money, but was shocked to find out from a Foodpanda service representative later on that the rider claimed he did not take any cash from them. She decided to make a police report that night.

> In response to queries, police confirmed that a report was lodged and are investigating the case.

> A spokesman for Foodpanda said on Friday: ""This is an allegation we take very seriously and (we) are investigating the matter as an immediate priority.""

> Ms Tan said that after she posted about the incident online, several other people contacted her and said that they had been caught in a similar situation.

> ""The rider would always tell customers the same reason - that he was injured in an accident,"" she added.

> A staff member of Foodpanda reassured her in a call on Friday morning that it is looking into the matter, and it would process a refund within 48 hours, she said.

> SINGAPORE - Food delivery service Foodpanda said its Instagram account was hacked over the weekend after a customer said she received crude messages from the account.

> In a Facebook post on Monday (July 15), Foodpanda apologised for any inappropriate messages customers might have received, adding that they should not respond to any activity from the account.

> Replying to queries from The Straits Times, Foodpanda said that it was liaising with the affected customer who got rude messages from the hacked account.

> ""We are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible,"" the company said.

> Foodpanda's Facebook post was in response to a series of Instagram stories by Ms Jenny Liang, 23, who said the company's Instagram account sent her a string of messages containing vulgarities on Sunday (July 14).

> The vulgar messages were sent to her after Ms Liang, who works in the programming industry, criticised Foodpanda's delivery service when she encountered issues with her food order earlier in the day.

> She received a partial refund from Foodpanda and said that the company had tried to contact her.

Interesting, I have lived in South Buona Vista and currently staying in Clementi, in total two of my order with Foodpanda got cancelled unitl now, that was because the restaurant I placed order with was closed by the time I had ordered and  the foodpanda app didn't reflect that. Also, whenever they cancelled my order they gave me a $5 coupon to make up for it,  so it was ok.

khaosdd,">	Honestbee salary - You receive a basic hourly salary of about $6 as well as a commission of about $8 per delivery. Apparently, you could even earn up to $18 per hour as a biker.

Doing a very simple calculation = $18 x 8 hours of work a day x 30 days in a month (If U are desperate for $ or super hardworking) = $4320

airgel,"I used to cycle for UberEats when that was still a thing. I think it works differently compared to the other services but hopefully I can give you an idea. The salary for UE was on a weekly payout, by order, abt $5-9 per order You can work anytime, but at the same time you aren't guaranteed an order. There are periods of high demand like lunch and dinner and they'll increase the rates to encourage you to work. They also gave me perks to work towards, like $abc bonus if I completed xyz  no of trips in a week.

Personally I feel it's not worth it, pay doesn't scale well with distance travelled, and unless you have ultra stamina, it's difficult to  keep it up and reach the milestones. I tried it bc I like cycling, but in the end it was too tiring and I was fed up with hobo-ing at nex waiting for jobs. Also UE favoured motorcyclists over cyclists so many of the perks that apply to MC riders may not apply to you.

breakbruce,"I am currently a part-time food courier with both UberEats and Honestbee. Here's what I can share about each:

&nbsp;

UberEats:

- You work anytime you want, anywhere. All you have to do to start working is go online on your Uber Driver application.

- If you work on weekday afternoons, I would recommend city area cos everywhere else has pretty much little to no demand

- Weekday nights and weekends are the best time to work UberEats in just about any location.

- Best times to work are 11 AM to 3 PM, 5:45 PM to 9 PM as multipliers tend to be the highest around these times, but it may vary by the day and location.

- I personally average around $11 per hour with added incentives working at Serangoon on weekday and weekend nights, as well as the city area on weekday afternoons but I rarely do the city area now as it is almost an hour away from where I live.

- Payment is calculated from Monday to Sundays, and money is transferred to your account weekly on Thursdays.

Unfortunatedly, I heard UberEats has stopped letting in cyclists as they have an over-supply of them now, so they are only open to motorcylists.

&nbsp;

Honestbee:

- This is slightly better than UberEats in the sense that they have a base $6 pay and $8 per delivery. 

- However, you will have use an application to reserve your work time slots beforehand, unlike UberEats where you can just start working by going online in the applications anytime, anywhere.

- Unfortunatedly, even though the advertised pay is up to $22 per hour assuming base pay plus two deliveries per hour, rarely anyone hits that amount. 

- In fact, most people do not go past a single digit per hour due to the fact that there is a lack of demand and thus deliveries throughout the entire island, irregardless of area.

- However, because there is a base pay, even if there are no orders, you still get to take home something. Get no orders with UberEats and you will be eating grass.

- Just like UberEats, payment is calculated from Monday to Sundays, and money is transferred to your account weekly on Thursdays.

&nbsp;

What I personally do for a typical delivery day:

- I would reserve slots for HonestBee in the afternoon near where I live in Serangoon, where I am paid a hourly base pay and given maybe one or two deliveries. 

- This way, I make around the same amount I would make doing UberEats in the city area in the afternoon, but I do fewer deliveries and spend less time getting cooked in the afternoon sun. And I do not have to spend time travelling to the city area.

- In the evening, I do UberEats instead and take advantage of the dinnertime demand near Nex. If possible, I'll take a slot with Honestbee just before 7 PM since demand for UberEats does not start till around that time.

- Once the UberEats mutipliers end in the evening, I head home. Typical hours for me is 11 AM to 3 PM for Honestbee, 6 PM to 10 PM for UberEats. 

For the whole day, I average between $50 to $80. Per week for tentatively three full days and one weekend night I take home around $200 in total.

&nbsp;

Of course, more importantly is to not try to maximise your per hour earnings by trying to complete your deliveries too fast. You will easily get tired and lose momentum for the whole day, and increase your chances of getting into an accident which will put you out of work for a long time. 

Pace yourself, what you earn in the long term is more important than what you earn in that one hour.",2017-09-07 19:29:09,72,,,/r/singapore/comments/6yl44i/any_ubereats_deliveroo_or_foodpanda_bicycle/

xarieongx,"Somebody else asked this before. Gonna copy and paste my comment here:

Worked Ubereats for 1.5 months. Living in Bedok but my friend and I chose Pasir Ris, better cause will only have to do deliveries in Pasir Ris.

(Pasir ris is just pasir ris in the Ubereats app, but bedok, kembangan, tampines, expo and simei is counted as 1 part)

Tried Bedok area on the first day and it was hell. Collect food from bedok mall, deliver to kembangan. Then collect food for another delivery at bedok mall again, deliver to Tampines. No point so Pasir Ris all the way for the rest of the 1.5 months.

Ubereats is count by total earnings for the trip x surge rate for that hour, so typically earn $10-16 per trip on sat/sun peak hour, $4-10 per trip on weekdays.

On a good day 3 orders an hour. There were a few times when my app was on for 8 hours, only got 1 order. Try to have the mindset whereby you work Ubereats more to exercise and earn extra cash, rather than to have a stable income.

Try not to work during non lunch/dinner timings. Very rarely get orders.

Make sure you get a phone mount, easier to accept orders and look at the map so you won't lose your way. DO BRING portable charger as well, cause the app is gonna be active the entire day to receive orders, which drains alot of battery.

The best perk about this job is that there will not be anyone bossing you around, it is OTOT so work anytime, rest anytime. 

TL;DR: Extremely unstable income, your earnings depends on if you get deliveries or not. Great for exercising and earning extra cash.",2017-09-07 20:33:48,7,,,/r/singapore/comments/6yl44i/any_ubereats_deliveroo_or_foodpanda_bicycle/

ImActuallyCarl,"It's been 3 month since I've worked with ubereats and I ride an electric scooter. The pay per hour depends on how fast you can deliver in that hour. Lets say on the weekdays 1 delivery I can earn about $5.74 and within that hour i can earn another $5.55 which total up to $10+ per hour. The problem i faced is that there are not many orders on the weekdays hence you might sit around doing nothing for the next hour . Even on the weekends , sometimes I sit around Nexx doing nothing for like 30 mins waiting for orders to come in. And there's incentive like when you finish 10 orders you can get earn extra money. Overall it's a fun job and the pay is every week so you won't go broke and you'll have the money to spend.",2017-10-15 01:05:06,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/76brl3/foodpanda_vs_ubereats_vs_deliveroo_riders/

uly2212,"deliveroo: 

entry - fairly straightforward: onboarding session online, after which you proceed to make appointment to fill out forms and get your gear. can be done in one single day. (note: $50 deposit for gear, returnable). You can choose your location then, but only one location is allowed and changing is very hard.

Operates on staff-o-matic app, there's an app provided so you can take up jobs and navigate to location etc. Bicycle/e-scooter VS motorcycle has different pay. Sign up for a slot on staff-o-matic, get to the place, turn on the app, and you're on.

Can't remember motorcycle pay, but bicycle is a base rate of $5 per hit with varying incentives based on various time periods and locations (greatest is weekend, evening, CBD). Motorcycle pay is more, but not that much more.

There's a tip box but people don't usually tip for a bicycle delivery since it takes quite long.

After filling forms and getting gear, you're practically free to do what you like when you like. I haven't done anything for the past 2 months since there's exams, and so far nothing's exploded.

Deliveroo: easy to sign up, no immense obligations. Prepare to earn at most 2 hits an hour if you're a bicycle guy. 

That's deliveroo as a bicycle rider in SG Sengkang/Punggol. I'm not sure about the rest. Hope this helps. You're better off doing part-times tbh unless you want to exercise at the same time, to which my thighs say this is great and my knee joints disagree.

But it is a risky long term strategy. This kind of non-transparent marketing, erodes customers' trust that they're using an objective platform to search the best vendors. It is as if google changes the search result to favor the website that pays google without telling the customers. As far as I know, google and other major online shop still put label to separate their ads with search result.

jupiter1_,"My 2 cents on this...
I think their logarithm is too smart.

It displays the restaurant that 1) can allow them to earn the highest commission fee first, then subsequently I believe they sort it by 2) popularity

So I assume the logarithm groups high potential restaurants (those that many will order and can allow for stack orders) so one driver can come and do the stacked orders at one go.

Whereas maybe OP restaurant is less popular and therefore is not even displayed. Probably they want to channel all possible riders to do stacked orders as compared to using one rider for one order which isn't efficient.",2020-06-06 03:20:44,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/gx3fxt/i_wonder_if_this_happens_in_singapore_a/

MrFantasticallyNerdy,"That may be their strategy of herding app users towards higher-priced businesses, and thus contributing to their bottom line.

I have no insight to their algorithms, but it wouldn't surprise me if certain users are preferentially provided with certain restaurants, based on their perceived and demonstrated ability to pay. The algorithm may also hide lower-priced businesses based on prevailing parameters, such as customers and delivery riders availability, to maximize earning potential for the condition. Basically, a prudent person *shouldn't* expect Grab (or even Food Panda) to be merely an app that provides unbiased searches and a platform to order stuff.",2020-06-05 23:58:11,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/gx3fxt/i_wonder_if_this_happens_in_singapore_a/
MrFantasticallyNerdy,"You're describing a systematic issue though. Businesses can only be if there are funds for them, and funds can only be if holders of such funds are willing to accept compromises on returns. The world we live in mostly doesn't work like that, even if there are a few that do. I like to cite Patagonia as one of the exception, not because I prefer their products (even if they are excellent), but because the company is built on a foundation that is balanced (between business growth, earth-friendly, and employee-friendly) in a way I like and appreciate. Even conscientious investors and company officials have to balance between what is ""unethical"" versus having enough to actually make the company work.

Don't believe me? If you have any money in stocks at all, do you know what the companies that you partially own do, and where they draw the line in terms of what is price gouging? If you can't answer that question, you may begin to understand the disjoint the current financial system has, and you may begin to appreciate that you are actually part of the problem. Heck, even if you don't own stocks, do you actually know what kind of company you're doing business with as a consumer? Like Amazon, and Alibaba?

We condemn China for stealing intellectual properties and ripoffs, while we promote Mothership. If Mothership is promoted so they can get attention, then I do not think China should be condemned for their help to improve technology.

SuperGira27,"Well, I worked foodpanda for awhile. The reason for the prolonged estimated time is due to the system prompting us to select the time the restaurant will take to prepare the food. The max we can select is 20min. Sometimes, there’s a really long queue at the restaurant and some restaurant prioritise walk-in customers. The waiter always tell the riders to wait when the riders tried to rush them. It can be annoying to many riders as it’s their main source of income and waiting means they are wasting their time and not earning any money. 

As a customer, I can also understand that it can be annoying to wait such a long time with an empty stomach. Especially when the estimated time seems to be extending infinitely. Certainly, there are drawbacks in food delivery that’s why I prefer to get the food personally myself. Otherwise, there’s other options as well.",2020-06-06 02:46:47,32,,,/r/singapore/comments/gx3fxt/i_wonder_if_this_happens_in_singapore_a/

executeorder69,"I did foodpanda delivery as a cyclist for a day. I was posted to the East office.

You take orders using your phone so you'd need a phone with good battery. You'll want to take plenty of water and be prepared to snack alot because you're gonna burn out quick. 

Orders were damn shag. You have to report to the office at the start of your shift, to sign in and collect your bag. Then off you go. Order are everywhere. I cycled from Paya Lebar > Aljunied > Paya > Aljunied > Paya > Tai Seng > Paya > Eunos > Kembangan > Bedok Reservoir > Paya. I actually took the MRT home from Bedok because I was so tired and couldn't be arsed to cycle to Paya then back home. 

Think now it's a little better. You can keep the bag so you don't need to report back. 

Pay wise it's better than retail and F&B jobs. Just hope your bike doesn't fuck up or shit like that so you don't need to spend more. Think it was like base $6 + $2 every order your complete (docket). I averaged 2.5 dockets every hour so $11/h for me. 

Go ahead if you want to exercise a ton. It's gonna feel super tiring and you have to wear their long sleeve shirt and long pants + covered shoes. It's good for people who don't want to work with others because you'll be alone.  Also, be safe, please be safe.

xarieongx,"Worked Ubereats for 1.5 months. Living in Bedok but my friend and I chose Pasir Ris, better cause will only have to do deliveries in Pasir Ris.

(Pasir ris is just pasir ris in the Ubereats app, but bedok, kembangan, tampines, expo and simei is counted as 1 part)

Tried Bedok area on the first day and it was hell. Collect food from bedok mall, deliver to kembangan. Then collect food for another delivery at bedok mall again, deliver to Tampines. No point so Pasir Ris all the way for the rest of the 1.5 months.

Ubereats is count by total earnings for the trip x surge rate for that hour, so typically earn $10-16 per trip on sat/sun peak hour, $4-10 per trip on weekdays.

On a good day 3 orders an hour. There were a few times when my app was on for 8 hours, only got 1 order. Try to have the mindset whereby you work Ubereats more to exercise and earn extra cash, rather than to have a stable income.

Try not to work during non lunch/dinner timings. Very rarely get orders.

Make sure you get a phone mount, easier to accept orders and look at the map so you won't lose your way. DO BRING portable charger as well, cause the app is gonna be active the entire day to receive orders, which drains alot of battery.

The best perk about this job is that there will not be anyone bossing you around, it is OTOT so work anytime, rest anytime.

Grab‘s just dipping their fingers into everything, becoming a jack of all trades yet a master of none. Foodpanda/deliveroo focused on food delivery, and given how they don’t usually do promotions anymore gives me the sense that they’re pretty much stable and not scrounging for cash like Grab. Their userbase is smaller but probably way more loyal to keep them profitable.

ngrenjie,"I used Grab a ton last year. They had that monthly subscription where you got like 20 $10 vouchers for $109. I had another subscription which gave me more free deliveries than I could ever use, and they would even slip me discounts for meal deliveries from time to time as well. Then at one time, Grabfood had no minimum order amount, which meant I could use it to order a single bowl of beancurd when my mom was feeling peckish at night. And I am sure Grab was losing money on every single one of these orders. 

Then came grabpay, and the whole tie-in with causeway point, and together with their debit card, I was getting rebates and raking in grabpoints everywhere and using them to subsidise even more rides. 

Deep down inside, I always wondered how Grab was making money, which made me even more determined to just milk their service for all it was worth, because part of me knew that all this simply wasn’t sustainable. 

I think Grab is a precautionary tale of what happens when you are awash in investor money and driven to expand at all costs without thoughts of how to eventually become profitable.

BR123456,"Oof I hate how companies keep pushing their virtual wallets. I was buying bbt with a friend sometime last year from LiHo, then they had a stupid thing where they couldn’t accept card. Only GrabPay or cash, dk if it’s still a thing. But it was bloody stupid and sort of forced my friend to have to top up his grabpay (it wasn’t necessary, but dude was holding up a line and panicked so he just selected $50 top up on impulse in front of the cashier...). Lucky I had cash so I didn’t need to do the same, but he didn’t and I didn’t have enough to cover his. 

It was during the whole messy fallout from the Obike fiasco that made me realise that all this company currency like points was worthless. If the company just collapses out of nowhere you’re shit out of luck. All that effort gone into collecting points, all that money you dumped in for credit - gone in an instant. You can sue, but the amount of effort and the return is not worth it for some small consumer. The credit you put in is just another form of venture capital to them to further pump into expansion, so when they collapse and you want your refund they can’t give it to you since they’ve burnt it on failed expansions. 

And for my friend who just threw in $50 like that, he was just damm irate afterwards and trying to brush it off saying he’ll use it up on grab rides later. If that’s how your customers feel using your service, it’s probably not doing a good job tbh. 

Ps I really dk how their payment system works since I don’t use it. Because of all the confusion I have around payment methods I just used cash instead if I can - a lot easier since it’s basically accepted everywhere and I don’t have to go through another middle man just to pay for stuff.

ngrenjie,"To be fair, I feel cash is the least worthwhile option since it doesn’t earn you any rewards. Mobile payments (either apple or google pay) is more convenient because I can trigger it directly from my phone or Apple Watch, plus you get your credit card rewards. Grab is more cumbersome because I still have to launch an app and scan a QR code, though for a while, 3% rebate was a pretty good deal, especially in stores which didn’t support credit cards. 

I actually wish more outlets would use Grab. I see it as a more accessible alternative to credit cards, because I just need print out a QR code to hang in front of the counter, instead of having a whole load of readers. I don’t have to fiddle with cash or change either. 

But I have no idea how Grab is supposed to make money here either. If I top up my grabpay account with my credit card, this means that Grab will have to pay a cut to the bank. And their cut from the merchant will be less than the rebates they give me anyways. 

So again, Grab is like burning money to get market share, and then what? Grab, Grabfood and Grabpay are all not making money. They had to cut their benefits to stem the losses, and then you realise that grab customers have basically zero loyalty to your platform, because they were drawn in by all the discounts in the first place.",2020-04-26 21:52:16,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/g8bgq2/grab_suspends_their_food_subscription_services/

BR123456,"Yeah I personally do prefer cashless payments if possible - I like a transaction record and I can’t do that easily with cash. 

When the QR codes came along I thought it was a great idea. Heck, people at the back of the queue can pay by zooming in, convenient as heck. 

But what happened when all these mobile wallets started coming along was that stores got rid of other payment options that originally could be used. The worst offender was LiHo which was why I mentioned it, because that’s Grab spoiling the market for everyone else by doing some exclusivity deal. I don’t have time to go linking my credit card to my grab wallet while standing at the cashier with 3 other people behind me waiting - cash it is. I had Paylah & Apple Pay at the time and they were seemingly getting phased out everywhere for f&b outlets so I couldn’t use what I already had. Bloody irritating. 

(Edit: I realised apple pay shouldn’t really be factored in there. Problem is that I’ve always had trouble using it for some reason so I don’t like using it... Like I seem to always have the wrong angle somehow and it keeps failing :’( it’s easier to pull out a physical card and press it directly on the reader, more chances of success. My cards are in my phone cover anyway - I use a flip phone case because it’s convenient to carry my IDs even though it’s out of fashion :/) 

And while all these incentives have been great for us, it’s not been as pretty for the ones running the stores we’re patronising. For that one piece of paper with a QR code the store owners have to pay some money for it, adding on to their overhead costs. And because of the way cashless work they’d have to wait for a while before actually getting the money, which can be a huge disruption depending on when the bills start rolling in. It’s a big reason why the cashless option doesn’t work well in hawker centres since they’re already running so close to the profit margin - without government incentives they’ll be in the red, and incentives cannot last forever. If the consumer is benefiting but the producers keep losing out, it’s not sustainable at all. 

At least now the trend is letting you use your card directly like that instead of asking to buy credit - they probably wanted to avoid the backlash obike had last year when they couldn’t refund. They’re hoping that the cost needed to process your wallet can be covered by your future purchases in other parts of their business like Grabfood, or maybe whatever premium Grab charges the store to put the QR code up. Pretty risky gamble, but they’ve got venture capital to burn anyway. 

But ya, makes sense to exploit their ‘generosity’ if you can now. Just keep in mind not to throw in more than what you get back eventually, and don’t get too dependent on them.",2020-04-26 22:30:57,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/g8bgq2/grab_suspends_their_food_subscription_services/

jmzyn,"Grab is living up to its name as a tech disrupters indeed.

They fucked their partners up with lower base fees. The average job is much less than $5/delivery now. 

They squeeze in stacked orders so you effectively get even lesser collecting and delivering 2 orders citing the deliveries are along the way (which in most cases are NOT! And to customers that are assigned last in the queue, good luck to you because if your rider gets stuck in a McD/BBT queue in between, you can wait forever for your quick fix order meal.) 

The incentives are harder to attain with higher standards and they recently came up with the silliest of team missions. I didn’t even bother to participate in it. 

They then misled the public with the stupid pizza pi chart in which they conveniently grouped the delivery fee into the pi, making it seem like the riders are taking over a quarter of the food order while they take less! The delivery fee is not supposed to be in the consideration of the pi chart.

And I don’t know why ST came up with reports of TOP riders earning 7k (deliveroo) and 5k (Grab) for March. I hope you guys still remember their stories of Grabdrivers earning 7-8k a month?! Ha ha ha.

It is just business. These kind of vouchers and subcriptions creates the illlusion that they had loyal customers which translates to growth so that they had excuses to their investors to inject more funds.

The-Darkest-Knight,"I'm a Deliveroo Plus subscriber, after the work from home situation started, I wanted to sign up for Grab's subscription too since they have pretty much all the restaurants that Deliveroo has, and so many more.

When I couldn't find it as an option, I called their Customer Care line, and asked them about not being able to see the Subscription. The person told me where to find it (like tap here and tap there) - I told them I know where it is, I don't see the GrabFood subscription. So then the representative said they'd send me a link, and using that I can get it.

The idiot in me was like, ""Oh wow, I've been a Platinum member for 2+ years, they're going to give me the subscription even though it's not available because I've given them so much business and they want to show appreciation.""

LOOOOOOOL

Obviously the link took me to the same page in the app with no subscription, and I called them back because I'm a stubborn asshole. Again the same thing, and this time they passed me off to a different rep, who said that it's been discontinued. When I asked why, all they'd say is that if it ever comes back, you'll know. That's it. It obviously isn't the person who made the decision, so no point arguing.

So much for all those bullshit, ""**We're here for you in these trying times**"" e-mails.

I'm glad I didn't cancel my Deliveroo Plus subscription. Delivery is free, and even though the choices of restaurants is a lot less, I'd much rather be their customer. I signed up when the subscription fee was $11/month. When Deliveroo changed it to $14 later, they kept the old customers on $11. No guesses for thinking what Grab would have done in the same situation. They would probably have charged an extra $3/month to make up for the lost revenue.

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Expat in S'pore does food delivery on bicycle & donates earnings to Children's Cancer Foundation

> A 49-year-old British expatriate originally from Wales has signed up as a GrabFood delivery rider in Singapore.

> He wasn't retrenched or anything, as he is doing it for a good cause.

> Anthony Houlahan, vice-president of strategy for telecommunications company Ericsson Telecommunications, is still keeping his day job but he is hustling on the side to raise money for the Children's Cancer Foundation (CCF).

> The goal is to raise S$100,000 by the end of the circuit breaker period -- which has ended, but Houlahan is riding on.

> The Singapore permanent resident, who has been living here for 18 years, said it is his way of harnessing his own restlessness, energy, and get some workout outdoors, while contributing back to society and Singapore, which he admits has been nice to him.

> Started on April 22

> Houlahan told The Straits Times previously: ""It was a completely spur-of-the-moment decision. I picked the CCF because I wanted to help children in need. They have done nothing to deserve their illness and have their whole lives ahead of them.""

> He then started his deliveries on April 22, after hearing the circuit breaker extension announcement on April 21.

> He raised S$4,500 in five days.

> Houlahan rides his bicycle to do deliveries in the evenings and weekends.

> He lives alone here as his wife and two daughters, aged 21 and 23, are in the United Kingdom.

> In two weeks, he raised more than S$15,000.

> On Day 44, on June 4, he updated that he has raised S$56,000.

> The money he raised so far came from delivery fees, as well as tips and donations pledged to the Giving.sg website, where S$44,171 has been raised from 293 donors.

> Donors can pledge to donate between five cents and S$1 for every dollar Houlahan earns.

> He reports the amount daily on his website and provides breakdowns.

> Going the distance

> He does about eight deliveries on weekdays.

> On weekends, he clocks more miles and does even more deliveries.

> He can start at 10.30am and finish at about 6.30pm.

> On one Saturday, he made 21 deliveries after cycling 77km.

> Working about 20 to 25 hours a week, Houlahan estimates a typical rider can earn about S$400, ST reported.

> Houlahan also told the BBC: ""It can be hot, it can be sunny, it can be wet. It's a tough job. A lot of people do that to feed themselves and their families.""

> ""So I have utmost respect for those guys.""

> Changed to Foodpanda

> Houlahan updated his website on May 31 to announce that he has stopped working for GrabFood since May 28, and has joined Foodpanda.

> He wrote that Foodpanda has agreed to provide a direct financial contribution to the campaign to support the Children's Cancer Foundation.

> He also said he believes Foodpanda allows him to earn more money per hour, and that it pays more per hour for food delivery having tried it.

The-Darkest-Knight,"Just received an e-mail from them, looks like they moved it forward.

Here's the e-mail I got:

>**Changes to your fees** From today, you’ll begin to see a ‘minimum spend’ of $18 displayed for Plus free delivery in-app. Your subscription means that you don't pay any delivery fee, as long as the order meets the minimum spend for that restaurant - no matter how far the delivery is or how often you order.

For those that order for a family or with their partners, this isn't going to make a huge difference. Your average order for 2 people via Deliveroo is going to be $25 at the very least.

This however, does impact anyone that orders just for one like people living by themselves or with flatmates. $18 for one person for a single meal is pretty high.

This is probably a strategy to remove exactly those people from their subscription base and focus on bigger margins for themselves with less orders rather than razor thin margins (or negative) with low order values.

Overall, Plus subscribers that are single or order for one:

1. Cancel their subscription out of annoyance and order with FoodPanda or GrabFood and pay the same delivery fee. Those guys have more inventory / restaurants on their apps.
2. Those that are living with flatmates probably have one or more people subscribed, so all but one will keep their subscription and they'll end up ordering together.
3. Order lunch and dinner together. Keep dinner, heat it up later.",2020-05-01 19:00:15,11,,,/r/singapore/comments/gbfvn0/deliveroo_plus_started_to_implement_18_minimum/

,"For dinner last evening, my friend brought another friend who I was meeting for the first time. This lady was her ex colleague. We all hit it off well. 

My Friend leaves. Friend’s Friend and I decide to have a cocktail before leaving as it was only about 8.30 PM. 

Thought we can continue a pleasant evening in the wake of the generally good conversations we had during the evening but to my surprise.. the lady suddenly becomes a polar opposite version of what she portrayed during dinner.. and starts attacking me..

She tells me I speak fast (I don’t).. so that’s why I have problems at work (again, which I don’t 🤣)

She said I need to work on my hair and I need to dress well. (Now I’m happy with the way I look.. I’m not a beauty contest winner of course but I generally am very presentable and I dress to the occasion)

She also suggested I have to eat well and make healthy choices as she felt I over ate at dinner. She had a cheeseburger with fries and whacked a full brownie topped with ice cream. I’m trying not to judge! 🤣

I also need to be happy with life and not overthink everything per her judgment.

Again, huh?!

By this point I asked her where all of this is coming from?

No response.

She said I’m lucky I’m fair skinned and taken after my western roots as opposed to my Sri Lankan ones (I’m Eurasian) so I need to learn to use that properly by dressing in a manner that compliments my body and skin type..

I didn’t know how to react to all of this because nobody has said such things to me?! 

By then I finished my cocktail, so told her I had to go too. She ignored me.. 

Then I asked for a separate bill and still told her a bye.. she still ignored me, by looking at her phone and her drink as if I wasn’t around..  I left.

I found this weird. I think her behaviour got to me because I’m still kind of thinking about it. So bizzare! Was she kind of talking to herself via all of the “advise” she was giving me?

How do you guys let go of idiots like this? 

I also am planning to tell me Friend about this.. wise move?",2019-10-02 11:37:29,24,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

N1_Procrastinator,"Sometimes horh, i wonder how my mum (the kraken) sees me. 

She went thru my bag and saw a lighter (my dad smokes, i took it so i could light a candle for a fren's surprise bday celebration) and immediately assumed I started to learn how to smoke. I showed her a video clip of the celebration with a lighted candle and she called me disrespectful (wot)

Then recently i went to drink at a fren's house with my Jc cca frens and she said ""you are only 19 and you are already drinking, when you reach 30 you are going to do drugs"" eh i very speechless leh.

I dont have history of running away from home LOL, heck my conduct grades in sch is excellent (my senior told me he nv saw someone with excellent conduct grade b4, i giving context not trying to flex). I dont always come home late, im a go home club-er (in uni, jc i just filled my time with cca/sch), stay home nua. I have a part time job teaching tuition tbh i feel that im a pretty solid child.

BUT, i admit i have quite a strained relationship with the kraken. I dont call her a kraken for no reason, i have always felt that i cant tell her anything because she would always judge/criticise/scold when i just want to share without receiving criticism. Whichhhh leads to me lying quite a lot. Sometimes i got found out, sometimes i dont. I always lie about what i bought (like a wallet or a pencil case) because she would scold me and said im wasting money, that im not a 'rich 2nd generation' (in chinese). 

Ah, all these lead to her not really knowing whats going on with my life. I dont actually know if she knows what im doing in Uni, i did told her before but her memory is quite bad/the chinese equivilent translation is quite janky. 

(My only comfort is that I have a younger sister who i am damnnnnnnn close with, so i will always tell her whats gng on with my life, she knows all my fren even thu she has nv seen them)

I always think about the day she will be gone and Im left with questionable memories of her. :/ I know i will regret, but this really feels unsalvageable",2019-10-02 14:08:39,11,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

On another note ...

Working life has been very strange to me. I mean obviously it is very different from school but like one thing I have learnt is that you should keep a professional distance between your colleagues and yourself. I was complaining about some work-related stuffs to a colleague whom I thought also hated her job, and I found out yesterday that somehow the whole office knew about it. 

School life/NS is usually simpler. Even if it is a scandal, it will blow over in a matter of time. At most people will just gossip. But in the working life, secrets and gossips are currency.

aMinerInconvenience,"Might be asking this again but eh

Consider a situation: you found a game, you enjoy it and really get into it. Along the way you make friends and have a great time in general. 

Soon the friends play it less frequently, the powercreep gets real bad and the company in charge of the game make some unsavoury changes to it. You stop playing it often.

You try getting back into it but every attempt results in disappointment and the game feels totally different. You try to play similar games but they don't feel as fulfilling and your years of experience in the old game does fuck even in similar games.

You try to forget you ever played the game in the first place but it feels like there's an itch that can't be scratched.

lets put friend A and friend B

  
So A was interested in something B does (he modd stuff) and ordered and paid the item in advance from him. B tend to take his time to do while A had a deadline on when he wants it and kinda casually told him in hopes he would fulfilled it. the day comes but B could not delivered. this goes on until A had to ask me (coz im a friend of B) to remind him. A could not wait any longer and decided to ask for refund. Not sure if he did refund him or not coz its between them.

A went to sue B and like cc me to ask me to tell him that this was his last warning. I pass the message to B and told A clearly that this is between you and him nothing to do with me.

So me and B we are in a group together doing projects in a convention that A was also in and somehow A decided to take a pic of our group logo and post on his IG with a big pay $ bro on it.

Philosophy is the basis of organised society - it doesn't need to be all dark and existential. It can be simple things like studying schools of thought on how humans should treat each other and the world, and perhaps by extension, question things like whether imperialism and colonialism were good for the world. 

It helps to formulate your own set of principles, and when people question why you do certain things, you will be able to give a firm and logical answer knowing why you feel that way.",2019-10-02 23:32:16,7,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/
heil_to_trump,"I don't think you might be ""less happy"" reading more. I found philosophy to be deeply interesting and provided me with another worldview. 

Take Nietzsche for example. Some might say that he's an inherently depressing/nihilistic writer and I would disagree. Not having an objective meaning to life does not mean that one can not be satisfied. On the contrary, not having an objective meaning to life opens up limitless possibilities and freedom that wouldn't be possible. You alone can determine what makes life worth living, not any other man or idea.

Then there's the whole idea of the übermensch. The idea that Man is capable of rising above himself and that he himself can replace God as the arbiter of morals and values.

No doubt you might experience cognitive dissonance or perspectives you might not agree with, but I think it's still essential to evaluate those points and make our decisions on rationality.",2019-10-02 23:03:27,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

triface1,"You gotta consider whether you wanna go down the piano or the synth route. 

You can play piano stuff on a synth, but the difference in the weight of the keys means it is doable but difficult to play on the piano something you can play on a synth.

You can't play synth stuff on a piano. Musically it'll sound correct, but the timbre and layers of instruments will of course sound different.

Haven't really looked around much, but a quick look on Luther Music brings the [Yamaha MX88](https://www.luthermusic.com/shop/keyboards/synthesizers/yamaha-mx88.html) up. It's a synth but has 88 keys, so you get the extra keys you may need if you want to explore classical piano pieces. The keys are weighted so you'll be able to build up a little finger strength and control, but the aforementioned difficulty in transitioning will still be there (very realistic weighted keys are found on models that cost a few thousand dollars). 

They also have smaller versions (whether in the same MX line or not). I'd suggest getting a 61-key synth as a minimum. You should still be able to play the majority of pieces you come across, but the keys will generally not be weighted anymore.

If you're really looking for a budget one, they have very small models that can realistically only be used as synths.",2019-10-02 11:01:38,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

some of the better ones from the PUA sides are:

“Don’t just think about what to say. Actually listen to the woman when they talk.”

“Don’t just be a yes-man. Stand for yourself. Value yourself.”

it’s a great stepping stone for me when I decided that I can’t just go reading forever and be a hermit.

The peaceful ones were ok isn't it? Police were just making sure traffic is smooth or w/e their duties require.

Riots is a dangerous tool.

Could be to de stable HK. Which is fairly successful.

traumenddreamz,"I agree with you totally, but I posted this quote thinking that we as citizens, were all conditioned to think that the police are people whom we can trust totally and they are the ones who execute law and order. 

However throughout these few months, many actions of the HKFP have let the HK citizens distrust the police force. This current situation as well showed how the HKFP was not following the code of conduct.
Instead of firing a warning shot in the air which will also deter the many protestors from ganging up on the police officer (and also its the code of conduct before shooting live rounds), he decides to shoot the young boy. Instead of the rubber bullet shotgun that he have in his hand, he decides to shoot a live round. Instead of the pepper spray, he decides to shoot a live round at point blank.
I would respect the police if they follow the code of conduct throughout the months of protests. But looking at all these instances, I’m afraid I won’t be able to put my trusts in them anymore.

Edit: my apologies, their code of conduct was newly updated on 9/30, they are allowed to fire live rounds if the situation may lead to life threatening situation instead of the situation is intended to threaten life in the old conduct.",2019-10-03 07:52:34,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

heil_to_trump,"> smacked by teachers in school, parents got called up, go home and another session of rotan awaits

>lessons from the kids: Never did said thing again lest you want the same beating

Lmao, I grew up with this system and you know what it taught me? It taught me how to do stuff without getting caught and how to steal/copy stuff from my classmates. I didn't learn good behaviour, I learnt how to manipulate people and fake stuff to avoid being punished. By the end of primary school, I learnt where all the food vendors kept their extra supply of food stock and drinks. 

Kids don't think in ""I'm getting punished so I shouldn't do this again"", they think in ""I'm getting punished so I should find a way to not get punished again"". 

You think that hitting your kids is gonna make them behave well? All you're doing is teaching them to not trust and confide in you as a parent. I grew up knowing that I can't count on my parents to talk about my personal issues, and if I ever had a kid, I sure don't want that to happen to him/her",2019-10-02 23:18:12,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

Boogie_p0p,"It depends on your parents lor. My experience is that they're afraid of letting go (they realize they need to but because due parental instincts they couldn't) and convinced themselves that what they did is all for my own good. So I had to ""train"" them bit by bit and show them their cause for worry is non-existent by doing first then ""ask permission"" later (asking permission first never works and will always end up with them being right because they intervened beforehand). I took control of the situation; whatever details they get is what I gave them. Take it or leave it. I won't provide more.

So our convo will always be like, ""See? Nothing happened. Relax lah."" but in a nonchalant way. Sounds terrible but it's like training a dog. They look to you to assess the threat level. If you come back fine and are chill about it, they will also be chill about it after a few times.",2019-10-02 17:13:38,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/
RinkyInky,"You can ask her why she has no faith in you or in trust in her own parenting. If it doesn't work then every time she says something ridiculous like that you should just lightly make fun of what she says, just to remind yourself not to take such statements so seriously. (eg. tell her you actually did drugs at 7 and you changed it to drinking at 19 so it's an improvement and by 30 you should be 100% clean.).

As for the money side if you can log your expenses along with what you have saved and earned and you're saving enough/not overspending, you can show her that you know how to plan your finances. If she doesn't like the way you are doing things ask her what's a reasonable amount/percentage to save as a Uni student. See if the both of you can come to a compromise regarding this.

Yes she/people around you can say she ""genuinely cares"", and maybe that's true, but it's not right for a parent to be so insecure and afraid it that she damages her own child/their relationship. Parents (who are supposed to be leaders) have to keep their own insecurities and fears away from parenting. Constantly being suspicious about the other party is a death sentence for any relationship.

Also, just because she cares, doesn't mean she can put it in a ""harsh way"". If she has a message to bring across, she can always do it clearly and patiently. Maybe you should speak with your father about this and maybe he can explain to your mum if she won't listen to you.",2019-10-02 15:19:18,-1,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

1) why is there no bigger news coverage on china people disappearing? Are you suggesting the whole country is corrupt in this sense and authorities can make anyone disappear if they wish?

If true why haven't rich people move out? Why are business still investing and growing?

2) same for the missing bookstore folks.

There's so many possible ways to spin this to whichever side you are on.

Eg: fictional story. The book store folks disappearance was a act commissioned by Russian whom in turn was actually instructed by trump.

Basically we have all been wrong and in fact Russian is working for USA. 

So now they created this spin so HK and china is in a mix up. So usa at the same time launches trade war and since HK may in future be a contributing factor to china, it's win win.

Fictional storytelling ends.

There. Depends on which side you are on, the story can be different spy theories.

_Solasura,"Sorry about joking that it’s simply due to me getting whooped a lot as a kid because it’s actually not as simple as that.  
  
In all seriousness, I do not condone senseless beatings amounting to abuse. In the beatings I’ve received, there were lessons to be taught, and these lessons were verbalised to me alongside corrective actions afterwards.  
  
For example, my mother made me write apology letters to my teachers despite getting whooped by both parties. Why? It’s not to inculcate fear of power or enforce false respect. It’s that I must learn that my actions will equate to consequences (and somewhat penance), those including both teacher and parents having to spend extra time correcting my wrongdoings.    
  
I regret to hear that perhaps you weren’t given ample reasoning for being whooped, nor given the chance to express remorse and repentance.  
  
After all, parenting is hard no matter which era. But the hard way does help to put the right values in kids...  
  
Is what I meant to say. But yea. We should still beat our kids (then tell them why we’re beating them). Peace.",2019-10-02 17:05:19,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/dc0ot6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

Because, duh, that high latency meant if people were rushing me they wouldn't see me before I already clicked their heads for a long time. 

There's a Battle(non)sense out there which analyzes the MW beta netcode with the discovery that the latency is higher than BO4's Blackout.

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Non-compliant e-scooter riders not their staff, say food delivery companies

> SINGAPORE - None of the non-compliant e-scooter riders taking joy rides around Singapore is part of their staff, said the three major food delivery companies on Tuesday (May 5).

> Responding to queries from The Straits Times, Grabfood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo said they have stopped working with delivery riders who use e-scooters.

> Grabfood, the largest of the trio, said it has stopped all deliveries via e-scooters since April 1 this year to ensure the safety of both their delivery riders and pedestrians.

> ""Our delivery partners are also aware that they are required to observe all local regulations as per our Code of Conduct. Any delivery partner that is caught flouting the rule may be suspended or permanently banned from the GrabFood platform, determined on a case-by-case basis,"" a Grabfood spokesman said.

> The responses came after Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min said on Monday on Facebook that ""some riders"" have begun taking to the roads again in non-compliant personal mobility devices (PMDs) during the circuit breaker period, a trend he called ""worrying"".

> He did not give details as to who such riders were.

> Some e-scooter users have still been seen riding on footpaths, from which they have been banned since Nov 5 last year.

> Videos circulating online have also shown e-scooter riders taking to the roads amid less traffic during the circuit breaker period, riding dangerously among vehicles. In one video dated April 12 and posted to online road safety group roads.sg, an e-scooter rider can be seen nearly colliding with a car. The rider is seen getting back on his scooter and hurrying off.

> Foodpanda said it is ""not aware of any riders"" still using e-scooters, and it has stopped all deliveries via e-scooters since mid-December last year to ensure riders had sufficient time to transition to other modes of transport.

> ""Foodpanda prioritises the safety of our riders, customers and of the public. We take all government regulations and guidelines seriously. In the unlikely situation that a rider is found to be riding a non-compliant vehicle, the rider will be blacklisted,"" Foodpanda said.

> Deliveroo has stopped taking on new riders on e-scooters since May last year, and no longer works with such riders.

> ""We have not received any complaints or penalties from the Government for incidents involving PMD riders on footpaths,"" the company said in a statement.

> An e-scooter shop owner, who declined to be named, said such errant riders were possibly youngsters - more commonly known as young punks or ""YPs"" among the e-scooter riding community - who had bought their devices off online marketplaces like Carousell.

> Related Story Mobility devices: Of blind spots and magical policy thinking

> They are taking this period of ""relaxed enforcement"" to go out at midnight, he said.

> ""They come to ask me to help change their tyres and such but I declined,"" he said, adding that he only works on legal e-scooters and the owners must also meet the minimum age requirement of 16 years to use an e-scooter in Singapore.

> He added there have also been cases of thieves stealing the batteries from the e-bikes of delivery riders, which have made it necessary for them to look out for one another when their vehicles are parked.

> The number of fires involving non-compliant PMDs nearly doubled from 52 in 2018 to 102 last year, with such fires continuing to occur.

> To tackle the twin issues of non-compliant PMDs and their fires, Dr Lam introduced the Small Motorised Vehicles Bill and an amendment to the Active Mobility Act in Parliament on Monday.

> The Small Motorised Vehicles Bill will introduce measures like import controls of motorised PMDs and power-assisted bicycles, and aims to prevent non-compliant devices from entering Singapore.

> The Active Mobility (Amendment No. 2) Bill will extend the coverage of the law to include path-connected open spaces.

> ""Together, they will give the Government greater authority and flexibility to improve safety, enhance active mobility connectivity and bring about greater harmony in our common living spaces,"" Dr Lam said.

sneakpeek_bot,"> # $7k a month as a food delivery rider?

> To save up for his wedding in December last year, GrabFood rider Muhammad Alif Mohd Jasmin worked seven days a week the month before.

> The 30-year-old says he made around $5,000 that month, clocking 30 trips a day.

> But while it is an achievable target, he cautions it is not sustainable in the long run.

> ""I had a motivation to achieve a target,"" he says.

> Mr Alif, who has been doing deliveries for GrabFood since late 2018, usually covers the town area and does 25 trips a day on his motorcycle.

> He targets to hit at least 15 orders from 8am to 2pm.

> ""Whatever I achieve after that is a bonus,"" he adds.

> With people staying home and more ordering food, hitting 20 deliveries a day is not hard these days.

> Earlier this week, food delivery platform Deliveroo reported that its top-earning rider raked in $7,095 last month. It explained that this would require the rider to work an average of 11 hours a day and earn an average of $21 an hour - more than the usual average of $17 an hour.

> Delivery partners whom The Sunday Times spoke to agree with Mr Alif that while it is possible to earn top dollar, the trade-off is one's health and well-being, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.

> Ms Sandy Lee, 32, who has been working for Foodpanda for two years, clocked about 27 trips a day during the year-end festive period.

> There is a price to pay... You will be very tired the next day and you could put your life in danger if you are rushing around too much. MS SANDY LEE, a Foodpanda rider who clocked about 27 trips in a day during the year-end festive period

> ""There is a price to pay,"" she says. ""I couldn't feel my feet. You will be very tired the next day and you could put your life in danger if you are rushing around too much.""

> On average, she does about 22 trips on her e-bicycle in a nine-hour day, earning about $6.50 an order.

> A Foodpanda spokesman says riders earn an average of $7.50 a delivery. With a surge in riders joining them during the pandemic, the company now has more than 8,000 riders.

> Grab's spokesman says it has recorded an 80 per cent increase in weekly applications to be a Grab delivery partner since last month.

> It launched islandwide delivery services earlier this month, which enable customers to order from almost 800 food and beverage establishments on GrabFood instead of just those in their vicinity.

> Deliveroo added more than 1,000 riders to its fleet this month. It now has more than 7,000 riders and expects to hire another 2,000 by the end of June.

> The platform has also seen 700 new restaurant sign-ups since January, with another 200 coming on board in the next two weeks.

> There has been recent controversy over whether food delivery platforms take ""too much"" commission from food orders. Many food outlets have also switched to doing their own deliveries or using third-party logistics providers.

> Delivery company Lalamove is now making more food delivery trips, says managing director Alex Lin, 34. These now make up 18 per cent of all its trips, compared with 8 per cent before Covid-19.

> But food delivery is still consid-ered a small portion of his business, he notes, as his company focuses more on logistics for healthcare and e-commerce. He has also seen an uptick in grocery deliveries.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Lalamove has about 8,000 active drivers, from a total pool of 30,000. Instead of charging a commission on the order, the company takes only ""slightly above 10 per cent"" from the delivery fee, which varies based on distance.

> It also allows users the option of adding a driver to their ""favourite"" list to continue to engage him for future deliveries.

> This has helped Lalamove driver George Li, 37, maintain a regular customer base. He works 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week, and earns up to $2,000 a week.

> It is about ""working smart"", he says, emphasising that good after-sales service is vital to retaining his regulars.

> Aside from making a living, what keeps the riders going in these trying times is more gratitude from customers in the form of tips.

> According to Grab, there was a 40 per cent increase in the practice of tipping last month, compared with the previous month.

> Mr Aaron Chuah, 39, a part-time delivery rider with Deliveroo, says it is heartening when customers show appreciation.

> ""A customer left a note outside the door with the words 'Stay safe' and a $5 note. A gesture like this means a lot to us.""

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Woman urges S’poreans to rethink cancelling orders after helping food delivery rider in wheelchair

> As the year comes to a close and many are busy with year-end festivities, for others, the new year is simply another day of struggling to earn a living.

> Advertisement

> Foodpanda delivery man struggled up slope for half an hour

> One Tan Yen Hua posted to Facebook on Dec. 22 about a hardworking Foodpanda delivery man she encountered.

> The young man, who uses a wheelchair, was according to Tan struggling up a slope in Bukit Purmei over half an hour, with people and cars passing by, before Tan and another man who was with her offered to help.

> She wrote how happy the man was when the pair approached him. She said she wasn’t sure how much time he would spend going up the slope if they hadn’t.

> According to Tan, the man had pushed his wheelchair from Tiong Bahru to Bukit Purmei to deliver an order.

> She said it was also dark and raining at the time.

> Tan said they then helped him to call the customer to check if he was able to confirm his location, or meet the deliveryman somewhere more convenient to collect his food.

> This was when they learned from the customer that he had already been waiting two hours — to make matters worse, he proceeded to cancel his order.

> In her post though, Tan remained understanding of the customer’s decision, saying she felt he had “the right to cancel”, and that they were “too kind [to think] that people will meet us nearby to collect the food”.

> Advertisement

> Think before cancelling order

> Despite her understanding of the customer’s actions, Tan also urged Facebook users in her post to think before cancelling food delivery orders on a whim.

> She said:

> “But I don’t think [the customer] knows that there is a young man trying all ways to deliver his food to him. Even two hours, still trying to continue his journey and never [give] up. Even raining, even get lost, even so tired, still want to deliver the food on time to his customer. I can see how difficult this handicapped young man is trying to work for his living.”

> This story is about to get even sadder — Tan said the phenomenon of customers cancelling their orders on the young man is not anomalous.

> According to her, the delivery man said cancellations are “normal” and he was “used to it”.

> Tan and the man eventually helped to push the Foodpanda delivery man’s wheelchair to the nearest bus stop, where he could then take the train back to his home in Sengkang.

> She even left him with a “red packet”, which she hoped “can bring him a smile when he reach home safely after a hard day work [sic]”.

fijimermaidsg,"The bigger question should be: Why does a wheelchair-bound person need be delivering food in the first place? It's surely not the ideal job in any context. I'm shocked and disgusted to see that commenters on both MS/FB and Reddit say that 2hrs wait is not acceptable in any circumstance. Why not text the delivery person? Maybe it's the SG inability to articulate? In any case, UBER has an indicator to let you know the driver is hard of hearing/is mute, so you have some expectations.

Do you think that Grab is so progressive that they feel this indicator would discriminate against wheel-chair delivery persons? Another way to think about it is... how would you feel if someone was desperately trying to deliver food to your sedentary ass, uphill and in a wheelchair?",2020-01-01 01:28:25,-9,,,/r/singapore/comments/ehzcch/woman_urges_sporeans_to_rethink_cancelling_orders/

oblivionraptor,"I think Foodpanda has the highest per docket pay among the three companies, but there's no distance incentive. E.g $6.50 per docket regardless of distance travelled. The more you work, the higher you rise through the batch ranking. Lowest is Batch 5. highest is Batch 1. It's like a game, but you grind it out in real life. You gotta have fast fingers if you wanna get your preferred shift timing, or else you'll have to either settle for unpopular slots (graveyard hours) or wait for someone to offer their slots. I do Foodpanda every now and then.

Grabfood, however, has the distance incentive. If I'm not wrong, $5 base per docket, and then you add in the distance and whatever bonus you have. This one can OTOT, but you can only cash out after you hit $50 earnings.

Deliveroo I have no idea, I don't have friends working with them. Should be the same as Grabfood.

You'll have to spend some amount of cash on buying their equipment, which is mandatory, so far I don't see anything regarding the use of second-hand equipment while working for them. I see people use unmarked and unbranded thermal bags, which goes against their guidelines. [Grab will penalize you if you're caught violating their equipment standards.](https://www.grab.com/sg/gfgear/) If you wanna use unbranded bags and not wear the delivery company uniform, at your own risk.

Anyway, I agree with what /u/zenqian has to say.

With Grabfood I don't have to book any shifts, and I still get a good amount of orders. Not to mention you have to provide an MC if you miss your Foodpanda shift.

bilbolaggings,"Hello, grabfood rider here. I did foodpanda for a bit before switching over to grabfood. I like grabfood more because it's a lot more flexible. I can just work whenever I want and how long I want. With foodpanda you have to book shifts, and these shifts are hotly contested in high demand areas, so you'll have to camp at midnight or pray someone let's go of a shift. 

Also grabfood's app has much better UI than foodpanda. Foodpanda's app is just really leceh. You have to deal with the dispatchers who are from Malaysia or India and a lot of them are hopelessly incompetent. 

I'd just go for grabfood if I were you. I never tried deliveroo so can't comment on that. They all pay quite closely though, I don't think there's one that earns you a lot more money than the other

Edit: Also grabfood lets you cash out your earnings whenever you want as long as it's at least $50. With foodpanda you have to wait for your pay to come in about once every 2 weeks. Sometimes your pay doesn't come in and you have to create a ticket to deal with foodpanda hq. A big waste of time tbh.

source : I delivered pizza using a bicycle

If you can don't use bicycle deliver cause it's super tiring and you usually have to travel 1-2km with a heavy box weighing you down. And don't forget about upslope and barriers which just a pain tbh. But if u have escooter should be piece of cake ah. back then I deliver using bicycle after seven orders I started regretting hahahaha. 

Have talked to friends who worked with deliveroo and foodpanda seems like they almost similar system such as ranking or tiers. If I'm not wrong you'll start with a certain rank and it will increase after you done a certain amount of deliveries. then the higher ur rank the higher your pay ah also higher rank have first priority to book slots to work. Deliveroo you will select the location and time but I don't know about foodpanda or grab food if you location is fixed but the selling point of deliver boy is that you have flexible hours which is convineint for students 

pay wise basic ah the more you send the more you get sometimes peak hour amount you get per delivery can double

that's all I can think off now ah if anything I add later

So you won't be able to tell if they're preparing your food etc unless you contact the chat.

Varantain,"Time for a Foodpanda rant:

Foodpanda has promotions from time to time, but their savings are capped at between $6 to $9, so people have to split their orders if they're ordering more than $30 worth of food.

Well, their system marked my second order as a duplicate and completely disappeared from my order history, but payment went through as I paid with Apple Pay.

Funny thing is that Foodpanda didn't communicate this at all, and the only way I found out was because I didn't receive an email for my second order (remember, though, that payment had already been taken), and couldn't find it in my order history.

They're too cheap to have phone support in Singapore, so the only way to communicate with them is through their live chat system. Some things about their live chat system:

1. push notifications don't work;

2. their agents take a while to reply, and seem to think it's fine to leave the chat after a couple of minutes of no response; and

3. their chats automatically disappear, with no way to access history if your app is closed long enough.

The only way I could get my issue resolved to its conclusion was to open my app from time to time, and keep checking for their agent's reply (hoping that they didn't think it was acceptable to leave the conversation before me). That wasn't fun, and made getting my second order either processed or refunded a serious pain.

They also made no effort at service recovery — I wasn't given anything even when I asked ""if there was anything they could do about all the inconvenience I faced"".

**tl;dr** Foodpanda's fine when it works, but isn't worth the time if one gets into trouble with their crappy app.",2018-08-06 23:18:35,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/94newv/how_is_your_experience_with_food_delivery_services/

The only major problem I faced was late deliveries. But sometimes I don't wanna blame them thanks to the unpredictable weather. It can be sunny and hot af when the order is sent, after 10 minutes the whole sky can just darken.

I've used Deliveroo the most and I'm generally satisfied with their service. The food usually arrives with 30-45 mins and the one time that it was 30 mins late, they gave me a $5 voucher after I used the live chat to enquire about the delay. They also have quite a few promotions here and there which are good. The only bad thing about Deliveroo is the minimum order and how they charge a flat $4 if you don't meet it, rather than the difference between your order and the minimum order (which is what Foodpanda does).

I used Foodpanda a few times and except for the first 1-2 times I ordered, every order has been late, usually because they don't have riders so the order gets ""stuck"" (for like half an hour) until I contact the live chat. And even then, no offers of recompense... Between the minimum order ($15) and poor service, I've stopped using Foodpanda.

I've used Honestbee food delivery twice and it's been good so far - delivery is on time though perhaps their selection could be expanded. There's also no minimum order so it's my go-to option for dinner now (Deliveroo's $18 minimum order for dinner is just too much for one person).

Just tried UberEats for dinner and so far so good. It's good that there's no minimum order but they tend to have surge pricing during peak hours so it might not be such a good option.",2017-09-18 19:03:53,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/70occt/what_has_your_experience_been_with_food_delivery/

doc-tom,"> Less than three weeks ago, a team of five — comprising four fresh graduates and one undergraduate — launched Heartland Chefs, which enlists housewives, or any resident for that matter, to whip up home-cooked food for sale. Inspired by the notion that many people want to eat home-cooked food but do not have time to prepare it, the team aims to shake things up in the food delivery business, where companies such as Foodpanda and Deliveroo have established a foothold.
> Mr Siddiq Poh, 25, a co-founder, said: “Deliveroo or Foodpanda can’t provide home-cooked food. This service is also more convenient as neighbours can meet each other nearby to collect the food. It can even lead to a sense of community as people get to know each other through this service.”
> Individuals can list their dishes on the Heartland Chefs app, which residents living nearby can place orders for, and subsequently collect at an agreed time and location within the neighbourhood.

Sounds like a pretty cool idea. My family often don't have time to cook and we are not good at cooking Chinese food.    I've always wanted to try my neighbor's cooking but am too paiseh to ask for a sampling.

On the subject of American-Chinese food, I always find the dishes to be pale imitations of proper Chinese dishes.

Taking American Chinese food for example, it is so different than traditional Chinese food that I'm not sure if pitting the two against each other makes for a fair comparison. American Chinese or Tex-Mex should be viewed as a subset of American food culture, much like barbecue, Cajun, NY/New Haven pizza, and Chicago deep dish pizza. American Chinese has been adapted to such a degree that it's a bit disingenuous to judge it in terms of authenticity. It's just always going to lose. You'd have to compare American Chinese against American Chinese.

Peranakan food, a fusion of the Malay and Chinese subcultures, is held in high regard in Singapore and Malaysia. In some ways, it can be seen as Chinese food that has been adapted to regional tastebuds, or Chinese renditions of the indigenous Malay food. Either way, it doesn't share the same kind of stigma that has plagued American Chinese. Yet, if you were to compare it to either traditional Chinese food, or traditional Malay food, it would probably be considered unauthentic as well.
