4,alainlicious,"Popular wanton mee @koungwtm now has delivery option on @grabfoodsg, in addition to their new dine-in outlet at @jemsingapore. I ordered in for lunch and took about 40 minutes to reach me.It’s great that they packed the soup separately, but might have to request for pork lard on the app because they don’t include by default. Taste wise, the noodles were still springy and chewy."

20,futuristfergo,"KEEPING THE DREAMS ALIVE - MY COVID 19 JOURNEYWhy do @grabfoodsg ? And how have your live change?The earnings may not be much, but it serves as my passive income. Before the start of every week, I will calculate the possible or expected total expenditure amount. I will then work hard to meet the targeted amount. For example, if I know that I’m going to have a meeting at @starbuckssg , and I will probably be spending, $30. I will do my delivery rides between classes or after classes to obtain the amount.However hard the circumstances are, I will never give up on my responsibilities and my dreams. I will keep my dreams alive.Aren’t you ashamed? There is a possibility that you will meet your clients or colleagues?Certainly, the possibility of meeting any of them is there. But personally, there is nothing to be ashamed of.Have you ever seen, the physically challenged individuals who are working? Or even the elderlies?I am more ashamed if I don’t do anything to better myself or my situation given that I am able bodied and capable.I’ve never been ashamed doing any kind of jobs as long as I know that whatever im doing is permissible in the eye of the nation’s law and from the perspective of my religion. Like many of us, I come from a family which encountered many hardships yet we continue to strive for excellence.When I was younger, my brother and I, we used to buy cartons of can drinks from @shengsiongsupermarket_official and put them in Styrofoam boxes filled with ice made from home. We then tie the boxes on to the additional passenger seats on our bicycles. We will cycle to hard to reach areas at East Coast Park, basketball courts and street soccer courts to sell them. Besides that, we also gave tuitions and worked as hotel dishwasher at Grand Hyatt. We paid for our A-level examination fees and we never ask from our parents for our school pocket money.To all of you out there if you’re contemplating, there’s nothing to be ashamed of.#resilienteconomy #startuplife #socialtechnopreneur #student #grabfoodsg #shengsiongsupermarket"

114,ray_yee,"Continues ... @lloydsinnAnother disappointment: I indicated that I would like to have a queen size bed during my booking. My bed looked like one but I realized it was joined together from 2 single beds. Come on! This is not a budget hotel! With the premium price that I have paid, I could not even get a decent queen size bed? To add salt to the wounds, during check-in, the staff at the concierge reiterated my request during the check in. If she would tell me that the bed I would be getting were 2 joined-single beds, at least my heart was prepared. The whole experience really spoilt my dream #staycationsgTalking about #customercentricity and #transparency these days... #lloydsinnsingapore has much to learn.Well I was determined not to be spoilt by these experiences. So I explored around the area for eateries 🍲 🍱 🥘.Indeed one is spoilt with choices - from local coffee shops to restaurants, a wide selection! Whether it’s comfort food from Killiney Kopitiam, or Hong Kong Tim Sum by So Good Char Chang Ting, there will definitely one that will suit you. Other choices will be like Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Western etc. Look out for my food reviews to some of these places I have visited next week.Lloyd’s Inn comes with a simple breakfast set, in collaboration with ABC, Artisan Boulangerie Co. as they don’t have a kitchen or restaurant in the hotel. They do have an outdoor seating areas where you can #grabfoodsg and enjoy the alfresco dining.Overall, a very unique experience. Would I be back again? Hmmmf, I would think twice with the same amount for a hotel that know how to appreciate their guests.Rate: 3/5Price: $$$........#ryphotographytravel #raymondyeehotelreview #hotelreview #sghotelreview #hotelbloggers #travelblog #travelsg #raymondyeetravel #singaporehotel #honestreview #lloydsinn"
115,yvwz_,Love your reviews Raymond! Helped me a lot in choosing my next staycation :)
116,ray_yee,@yvwz_ Thank you for taking time to read! You are most welcome 🙏🏻
117,peppermintjn,"Thanks for sharing! From the view of price per night, I think cruise may be much more worth with meal, sports and entertainment inclusive 😜 Let me know if u need any info!"
118,ray_yee,"@peppermintjn Yes I will DM you one of these days, as I am a bit occupied with projects. Thks for the offer 😊"
119,eatswithluisa,Such a shame~ is this like a villa sort of resort hotel? I have yet to encounter 2 beds joining into one to make it like a queen size before at any hotel be it budget or high end ones 😬
120,ray_yee,@eatswithluisa did you managed to read the part 1 of my post? It’s a boutique hotel. 😊 You can look at the photo of the room layout or the video... *hint* the wall plugs and of course when you started to lay in the middle of the bed... 😮
121,eatswithluisa,"@ray_yee okay sorry, i missed it earlier. I feel like I could almost sense your disappointment while reading your part 1 post. I would have felt cheated as well if I were in your shoes. They should at least specify it properly at their website... 😞It’s not a big deal but I know it can dampen the mood alot. I also agree cus. service is very important, especially for better hotels. The surroundings reminded me of my resort trips in Bali :) That’s why I thought it’s a villa or something."
122,ray_yee,"@eatswithluisa No worries 😉. Yes they have one in Kuta, Bali. Hence the design and layout has the Balinese flair. It’s supposed to be like an oasis in a city center of Singapore. Honestly I was really looking forward for the stay, after those Instagramable photos and good reviews. Alas... 😢"
