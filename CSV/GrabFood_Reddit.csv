sneakpeek_bot,"> # GrabFood rider spends 1 hour helping office ladies dismantle & assemble chair

> A group of office workers in Singapore got into a bit of a pickle at work when they tried but were unable to assemble one of their new office chairs.

> Wrongly-assembled chair

> One of them, Mala Devi, told Mothership that they were befuddled by the assembly of the furniture and how it eventually turned out.

> Mala added that the supplier had assured her and her colleagues that setting the chair up would be an easy job and to simply follow the instructions.

> It wasn't the case, however.

> Here's a picture of the chair after they had assembled it.

> Doesn't look too good for one's posture.

> Rider to the rescue

> Thankfully, a GrabFood delivery rider who arrived at their office to deliver food came to the rescue.

> Mala shared that the rider, Ku Soon Ming, noticed the atypical chair.

> Ku took a closer look at the chair, and Mala's colleague then asked him if he would be able to fix it.

> He replied that he would try.

> And proceeded to spend the next one hour figuring out what went wrong and completely dismantling and reassembling the chair.

> It turns out that Mala and her colleagues had used the wrong screw when connecting the various parts, a piece of information which Mala noted the instructions failed to include.

> Mala then expressed her gratitude to Ku who decided to extend a helping hand to them.

> She wrote that for delivery riders, time lost was income lost.

> She and her colleagues also tipped the rider S$10 as a token of appreciation for his kindness and patience.

> Although Ku initially refused, he eventually accepted the cash after much persuasion.

> Mala said: ""Kudos to Mr Ku Soon Ming for being a kind Samaritan of the day!""

> An 18 year-old GrabFood rider was arrested on Jan. 16 by the police after he collided into an eight-year-old girl along a Bukit Batok footpath.

> The collision shattered the girl's glasses, leaving her with a bloodied face.

> She also suffered an eye injury and had to undergo eye surgery, reported The Straits Times.

> The girl's mother, Sathiya, told ST that she walking home with her daughter on January 15 along Bukit Batok Street 52. They were with another mother-daughter pair.

> Along the way, they spotted a GrabFood rider cycling towards them. Sathiya told ST that she nudged her daughter and the other girl behind her even though the cyclist was not going fast.

> After the rider passed them, Sathiya heard a loud scream. She turned around and saw her daughter lying on the ground with glass shards and blood on her face.

> The cyclist was apologetic and even cried, the mother said.

> The girl was sent to the National University Hospital (NUH) where she underwent surgery on that day itself. ST reported that the girl is expected to undergo another round of surgery next week.

> The GrabFood rider has been suspended. If convicted of causing grievous hurt by performing a negligent act, he could be jailed for up to two years and fined up to S$5,000.

Was he speeding? What is ""not that fast"" speed? & Most crucially of all: Was the rider using a mobile device while cycling, and was he aware of the presence of the pedestrians at all?

All these questions need to be answered, because like I said previously, an incident like this really shouldn't be happening at all. And it's not as simple as resolving the situation with a 3 letter word called: ""Ban""

McDonald's has a high status among the proles, one of the best places for unskilled workers to work at. Han Bao Bao is also Saudi owned.
