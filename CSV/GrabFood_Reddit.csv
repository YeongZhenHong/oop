Please call their customer service. And get them to compensate you with a $10-$20 off for your next order =). Remember need to call them and explain your situation then demand for the compensation.,107,2019-05-03,20:18:37
"Worst part is if you order food through grab app ( since now they are migrating grab food to main grab app ), until food is delivered you can't even get a cab . Vice versa too, I.e if you are riding a cab you can't order food..


I ordered food from my home for parents and I had to go to a party, guess what I couldn't get a cab till my food was delivered.",40,2019-05-04,00:07:12
"Update. Food from other service and restaurant at similar distance arrived in less than the 30 minute estimate.

Tbh the only time I use grabfood is when there is a coupon code of macdonald,20,2019-05-03,21:57:59
"Happened to me once. Ordered McDonalds. Everything goes as per normal within the time frame given. Order received, driver assigned, driver at the restaurant, driver is on the way, then order delivered. I thought, maybe the driver accidentally pressed the “delivered” button on his phone, so I waited 15 more minutes. Still no show. Call the driver, he picked up and said that it’s delivered and he has passed the food to somebody. 
Since I lived in condo, the security has to intercom me whenever there’s any visitor for my unit. So, I went down and asked the security, both the security guard said there’s no food delivery coming in on the last 30 mins. I was hangry. I ordered another food (still with GrabFood, what can I say, I like to collect points) and it arrive safely to me. I don’t even bother calling their customer service. I sent an email to them, they said they’ll investigate and 1 hour later give me a coupon code for $5 or $10 off (can’t rem) and fully refund back my McD purchase.

My guess is the driver ran away with my McD as it’s too tempting to resist. Or, maybe he’s just hungry.
Can’t place the blame fully to Grab tho, sometimes when you’re having an unlucky day, these thing happens.",17,2019-05-03,23:24:40
Their app update SUCKS. For some goddamn reason they decided to merge it back into the main Grab app and now you can only place one order at a time instead of being able to place several. Godammit.,6,2019-05-04,01:01:08

"As someone who is currently signed up to be one of these delivery riders (not grab food, also yet to start working) I've seen quite a few times in the delivery rider chat group, riders complaining that the stall/restaurant is actually closed when they arrive to collect the food. Seems to be quite a common issue, I guess these apps are still pretty buggy...",3,2019-05-04,10:27:28
"In my experience, Foodpanda takes the cake as the absolute worst service. Delivery is mostly always late, no notifications informing late delivery, food is always all mangled up upon delivery and the most insulting of all, they compensate unfulfilled orders with a $5 coupon with a minimum spend of $25.

Fuuuuuuck that. I deleted Foodpanda ASAP.",6,2019-05-04,01:47:13

"Disappointed with grabfood too. The app provides a scheduling feature where you choose a timeslot when you will have your food delivered. And I always get my food an hour or more earlier than my reserved slot.  And worse, I am still not at home to receive the order. Ok grab, I get it - you immediately assign my order to a rider. But what is the point of the scheduling feature then? For all these orders, I shared my complains to grab but nothing has changed. Never had these issues with foodpanda or deliveroo.",3,2019-05-03,22:43:58

Happened to me before. The deliverer also switched off his phone. Waited 1 h 30 min in the dark. Got too hungry so decided to eat caipng downstairs.

"Grabfood requires top up to their eWallet, and that's the reason I refused to use it. eWallet promotes impulsive spending as users often want to spend away any remaining credit in their eWallet. Topping up and not using the app would be a waste, hence it's a great ""lock-in"" mechanism for Grabfood to maintain it's user base. Comparing it to Foodpanda, it allows COD, so I never had the urge to overspend, so far the service has been satisfactory.",2,2019-05-03,22:28:13
"Sounds like you had a pretty crappy experience! I've been lucky in that I've actually had pretty good experiences with Grab Food so far. I've had one time when an item was left out of an order, but I have a feeling it was the restaurant's fault and Grab compensated me for it afterwards.

I work as a rider for another food delivery company. There are times too when I receive orders that are to be delivered at a later timing. The problem I think lies with the merchants.

">My portfolio performance is I'm in the green for 4 months.

4 months is a short time frame. We have been a bull market for the last 10 years or so, most younger investors have not experienced a bear market. Do this for a longer period before making any drastic changes.

I'm not sure about your portfolio size or Grabfood but 1.5k means that you need to be earning about $18,000/year. Assuming you're getting around the same returns as the DJI historical returns(+/-10%/annum), you would need a portfolio of around $180,000. If Grab provides about half of your income, you would need a portfolio of about $90,000, and this is assuming that

1. You have enough emergency cash through a bear market
2. Portfolio size stays around the same through a bear market.
3. You're able to get similar returns to the index
4. Liquidity isn't an issue
5. Currency risks aren't a concern
6. No other concerns in future. E.g. Health, Significant Other, large purchases
7. No inflation
8. No tax
9. No commissions

LOL on paper it sounds nice ah say can override and whatnot. The army culture is to follow the chain of command and any attempt to override that is seen as a slight against the commanding officer. As if any poor medic with a maximum of 6 months training will have the balls and the confidence to stand up to the OC?,39,2020-09-26,23:31:44
"> Medics are allowed (and obligated) to overrule superior officers in situations involving the medical care of soldiers.

I don't know how true this is to be honest. This sounds like those tales that NSFs tell but nobody knows if its legit because its too logical and SAF isn't logical. For example, SAF drivers during my time even if there was an emergency have to keep to the 50KM speed limit. Only with a waiver and approval command by the Vehicle commander can it exceed. 

There was one time some guy got stung badly at murai and had an allergic reaction. So my mate got activated to ambulance him over to the hospital. Had to go through vcom approval etc. Lucky the vcom also scared to get in trouble so just say ok go ahead zoom to hospital. But if the vcom say no, then the driver also lan lan suck thumb stick to 50KM otherwise what the fuck is the point of that protocol?

Ya I know its not a medic but the scenario is very similar, in the event an emergency happens and the standing order is no, what do?",23,2020-09-26,23:13:56

"The takeaway is that Grab's prior levels of commission rates to riders, F&B stalls and consumers have never been sustainable. This is the key takeaway. The branch will have to break somewhere:

1. F&B's profit margins (amount earned after all the fees and commission are subtracted which may make it unsustainable for them)

2. Riders' fees and incentives (Not worth for bike riders, hard to earn a decent living after petrol for the motorcyclists)

3. Grab's profit margins (Asking a for-profit company to do that is just not gonna happen because they have a responsibility towards their shareholders too)

4. Customers' spending power (All these problems would disappear if customers was simply willing to pay more but how many can afford to? We can save the F&B stalls by dabao-ing in person but Grab and riders would be shafted and it'd also go against the spirit of current Circuit Breaker measures. If we start cooking at home, we'd be killing all three - Grab, the riders and the F&B stalls.)",38,2020-04-15,03:42:57

Then, there's additional delivery fee. And the food usually comes not as appetizing as it does if I just buy it myself and brought it home. 

My clients in the F&B industry will complain about grab / food delivery platforms with their predatory tactics. In the end, the F&B outlets, unless they're big enough (like the golden arches), will suffer at the hands of the platforms.

"Actually from this equation, based on recurring manpower operating cost per stakeholder type:

1. Restaurant (Assume 10 person)
2. Rider (1 person)
3. Platform (Restaurant support, Rider support, Tech (app), Tech (infrastructure), Sales (to get new vendors), photography, restaurant logistics, marketplace management, Operations, Supply chain (for device and equipment), Finance (Billing), Marketing, Data team, Security team etc.

Breakdown of earnings:

1. Restaurant earns $17.55
2. Grab Driver earns $8 (Assume), lets be real, riders won't accept this order unless forced to do so due to the 8km distance, will be grabcar drivers.
3. Delivery app $22.7 - $8 = $14.7

Ultimately in this pricing structure all parties must be agreeable to the model. No one party really gives a shit as long as each other party is able to derive value to sustain their own needs.
  
Shit happens when profit structure prove unsustainable for any one party. Like i mentioned in an earlier post on another thread, riders are the expandable commodity in the current environment.

Restaurants main goal is to tide over this shitshow of Covid lockdown + explore inhouse / contracted delivery.

Platform main goal is to onboard as many restaurants as possible and ensure minimal problems in order assignment to riders/ fulfilment. 

Moral of the story: STAY THE FUCK HOME BECAUSE

1. Restaurants can earn 100% of the profit pie once this situation becomes better to allow walk-ins
2. Grabfood drivers go back to Grabcar so riders get orders
3. Platform goes back to their normal operational levels 

Lastly i would like to add, if possible, restaurants should focus on making dishes that survive better while being delivered and find their competitive edge/ offering against their local competitors (Eg: Introduce sides rather than only selling a protein + carb combo/ see what cuisine type is lacking in the area and make it happen)",3,2020-04-15,09:26:56

The lawsuit alleges that these companies — including Seamless, which is owned by Grubhub, and Caviar, which is owned by DoorDash — place restaurants in a tough spot with the commission, and that restaurants in turn are forced to charge customers more to make up for those costs.

"Food delivery apps provide a low bar of entry for riders. The apps do simplify the workflow of delivery. You can walk, kickscooter, cycle with an unpowered bike. To work directly with a f&b business, you have to have a minimum of an ebike and have some experience riding. 

Riders are now struggling to get enough orders from customers, and every day more riders come aboard. We need to support these out of work riders and order more from apps. 

Do order from local businesses near your place so riders can have a quick delivery. We're too poor to order food, so idk how to save costs. But you can sign up for multiple accounts in your household to get the various forms of discounted delivery once you run out. Ordering (slightly) before and after peak periods would let riders earn for more hours, reduce their waiting time and the stall's prep time. 

Grab's food delivery service is now subsidising its transport services. Foodpanda and deliveroo should take the lead and follow the example of its American counterparts who are at least doing something. This is their opportunity to gain marketshare against the dominant player. 

The minimum that can be done is deferring commission charges, which isn't ideal as restaurants still have to pay afterwards. Doordash is waiving commission fees for new to platform restaurants for 30 days and takeout fees for all restaurants, as well as halving commission fees for restaurants with 5 or less locations until the end of May.

When you use Grab, you pay for massive overheads. You subsidize other parts of their “empire” that they want to price aggressively to gain market share. You fund their ubiquitous marketing. You pay for the dividends going to the shareholders.

With a non-profit, you could operate the same island-wide service at cost, pay all parties involved (lean back office staff, delivery drivers) a fair wage, and have not an extra penny in overhead (no marketing, no dividends, no ancillary business, etc). The cost to F&B outlets would be considerably less, and any surplus at the end of the year would be reinvested in improving the performance and lowering the cost-to-serve.

The only road to profitability is:

1. Complete market monopoly resulting in raising delivery fees for the customers or the merchants. This may not even be possible as new unprofitable disruptors will just join the market since barriers are low. 
2. Some other way to drastically reduce the cost of delivery: robot delivery or some crazy good route optimization.. but these are all still ages away and come with physical limitations.

My take is that delivery fees will shoot up eventually, and customers will just have to accept it. Either that or they all go bust and get replaced by some new start-up funded with deep pockets.",11,2020-04-15,14:43:10

If the restaurant choose to increase price on grab to cover their share of the delivery cost, then everything goes to the customer.

"True.

A small eatery near me absorbs the costs and sells at the same price for Grab/physical customers, and all I can say is that their business has been booming since - in this case they're seeing it as gaining NEW customers that otherwise wouldn't have patronised them, instead of seeing it as losing 30% to delivery apps when regular patrons order online instead.

"Yes. The issue is marginal cost is high. Each delivery ride is costly especially for perishable goods like meals which have to be delivered in 30 min within ordering - this limits route optimization which often lowers cost. (Ie I can consolidate all orders from ABC restaurant to deliver to Block 123 residents all at once.)

If marginal costs are high and unit economics are fundamentally unprofitable, then scaling WORSENS the problem. Scale only helps if there are high fixed costs and low marginal costs. 

Maybe a complete monopoly may help but honestly I think they either need to have
- high minimum order size 
- high fixed delivery fee 

You see most f&b outlets who are going it alone are doing both. It fundamentally doesn’t make sense for a human being to spend 5-15 min riding to a restaurant and another 5-15 minutes riding to your place to deliver a $10 meal.",3,2020-04-15,17:56:05

I try to force myself to keep to my working hours as much as possible and my family know not to disturb me during those hours. All of my meetings are still going ahead as scheduled; just all online; the main difference is that people are generally not late for online meetings which is a nice plus.

My company is quite used to wfh (flexible, just let your manager know if you need to wfh) but not everyone was prepared to wfh for the long term. But thankfully my company provided everyone with one-off allowance so you can buy what you need- monitor/desk/chair/IT peripherals/even childcare/airpods etc. 
People been coming together over zoom/creating slack channels to stay connected. Global Virtual lunches, happy hour... Sharing workstations, memes etc. You kinda feel more connected with your global colleagues during times like this!

"TL:DR Don't be an arsehole, order food by 6.15 for best results",679,2019-05-06,16:07:57
"Worked as a foodpanda cyclist for about 3 months after NS and here are my opinions on foodpanda.
The process for an order are in 3 phases 
1) accepting the order
2) collecting the order
3) delivering the order

We had 15 minutes to collect the order and 15 minutes to deliver. At every process there is always a problem. 

Before even accepting the order the 15 minute timer has already elapsed. The order is already allocated to a Rider, if I as a rider didn’t accept it because I haven’t completed my previous order or whatsoever, the algorithm will send it to another rider. Sometimes there aren’t enough riders , so the wait just continues.

When collecting the order, some places are extremely busy especially at zi char stores. These stores aren’t well equipped or have a system in place for delivery services. Usually they prioritize the customers physically at their store and so the wait continues. Once I waited 1hr for 2 packet of fried rice.

Delivering the order, it’s a matter of following the GPS and just cycling. The only possible fuck up here is if you put your address wrong. The only problem is usually condominiums, sometimes the security system is so fucking annoying requiring you to do 10000 steps and the customer never wants to collect the food from the guard house. And sometimes the security guard is a  cunt.",40,2019-05-06,18:54:33
"I don't think the problem is with the riders. A majority of people do not fault the riders, the ones that do are assholes. Period.

Foodpanda and their various competitors are the ones at fault here. Setting ridiculous timings for food to be delivered is really asking for complaints to be made. The poor riders, as the face of the deliveries, would eventually pay for this poor managerial decision. 

For example, if one were to go on Foodpanda and order a meal from a foodplace, the app would give an estimate timing of delivery (e.g 20mins). This thing is, the customer would assume that after paying for their food, it would be delivered in 20mins. This is not the case. Foodpanda would firstly have to allocate the rider for the job - this takes time. A lot of it. Meanwhile, the 20mins timer would have already start counting down.

If it takes 15mins for the rider to be allocated, the estimated timing should indicate 35mins, right? Well, Foodpanda does not seem to think so. I have seen this from Grab too. Suggestions to suspend food places does to not seem to be working effectively and efficently. (Only during peak periods, for what I have observed.)

The number 1 place where delivery is seemingly consistent, more often than not, and would always set a benchmark in the food delivery business is non other than Mcdelivery. 

The rest of the industry players really need to improve their delivery processes. The only good thing they have going for them is price.

Normally there’s a timer for every order you receive. Sometimes it’s 13 or 10 mins. Worst is when it’s like -5 mins. It’s probably an order which another rider rejected or something. 

But what’s even worst is when you’re early to pick up the food but the vendor takes like 30 mins to prepare it. Then because of them, we have to rush ourselves. 

A lot of the customers don’t complain when I send them late & I’m thankful.

yesterday when I ordered Pizzas, I was thinking the same. Maybe, for food delivery guys they should have a different system. Normally, they ask him to add his details, the receiver's details, packet details, etc. Instead, they should take a picture of him and ask where he wants to go - the guy can deliver and later while returning he can provide the details. Or the security guard can collect his ID and allow him to deliver first (so the customer gets their food fast and hot, rider gets to reach there on time, and anyhow the details can be filled at security cabin).",6,2019-05-06,19:43:25

Agreed that McD is different vs Foodpanda and Grabfood, but the time allocated to find a rider should be added into the time given, maybe giving about a generous average time (~15 minutes or so during non-peak hours?) and the actual time food would be delivered. 

There’ll be people who would rather have early/on-time drivers, and hence trust that company more, than one who constantly has drivers not deliver the food ‘on time’ . And when word-of-mouth gets around, plus smart marketing, there’ll be people who switch over.

Also, being accurate at estimating food at 40mins (example) vs estimating 15mins but taking 40mins...

There's a time and place to be compassionate but this is a business like all others and no customer has to be obliged to follow your bleeding heart tendencies.",-9,2019-05-07,00:43:28

"rules of the jungle baby, no room for compassion lmfao talking like youre on some man vs wild shit in 'the real world' youre the one thats gotta grow up",1,2019-05-07,09:43:30
"man 2 hours is way too long to wait—if it's like 20-30 mins late, I'll ask the service provider to cancel and if they refuse/cannot do it, I just get my CC issuer to cancel the charge, haha",20,2019-05-06,18:40:29
"Happened last week to me, got an order estimated at 25 minutes. Waited for around 30 minutes, then got a notification that the restaurant did not accept my order. Had to re-order from a different restaurant as the original restaurant was no longer available anymore and this order took 30 minutes. This was on a weekend at 4:30pm by the way.

&#x200B;

Like, I understand if a restaurant does not accept an order if they are busy or the food is no longer available. Taking the entire length of my estimated order time to do this, however, is not acceptable by any means. Limit the time where restaurants (or foodpanda themselves) can choose to accept/cancel orders to say, 15 minutes, to make it less frustrating for us.",5,2019-05-06,18:50:19
"I've only ever ordered with Foodpanda/Deliveroo/GrabFood/UberEats less than 10 times in total, and thankfully never had a bad experience!

Can't imagine waiting 2 hours for food delivery, haha",1,2019-05-06,18:43:37
Their rental is cheaper coz they don't have a big dining area. Their business model is centered on delivery. Up side is there isn't a delivery charge on your orders.,2,2019-05-07,03:42:20

"Compassion? You're talking like they need some actual help like an orphan or something. 

If you choose to fast, is it fair to offload your personal choices onto the business owner or the consumer of said services?",3,2019-05-07,09:49:56
"Haha yeah if its any other time i would have cancelled it on the 1st hour, but i was busy with work so i didnt pay much attention to it until i ask myself whats taking so long for the food to arrive",5,2019-05-06,19:13:14
"My brother was super ok with it. Prob cos he was damn hungry and tired. As for me, I just sat down in a daze, unable to comprehend Foodpanda's delivery service - service which i was actually paying extra for.",1,2019-05-06,18:55:44

">	It’s rather shortsighted to refuse to express slightly more care and consideration during this period.

Can you point out the part where I said that? 

I said that fasting for health or religious purposes must not be used as an excuse to reduce productivity at the expense of the business. 

Both the employer and employee could of course try to find ways around it (e.g providing snack/power bars to support riders who choose to work through dinnertime without breaking fast) - it is up to them to figure out a win-win solution.

Are clearing trays specifically part of a cleaner's jobs? If they are, of course the cleaners should do their jobs. 

If they are not, then I support raising civic consciousness to help keep hawker places tidy. But which is which? This is a poor example to use btw - it's completely unrelated to the question at hand.",6,2019-05-06,22:07:59
"In the past, my family once tried tingkat services because my mother was working full-time and had no time to cook. We also lived in a remote area with few food options.

However, we gave up because we did not find tingkat food really tasty. We will never go back and do our own cooking now, especially since we are under budget constraints.",6,2020-05-02,13:10:28
"The tingkats are dedicated to you and you will be the one responsible for washing it. If it concerns you, ask for the food to be delivered in disposable containers. 

Tingkats are OK if you are not choosy, willing to eat whatever is served and don't want to spend any cognition to deciding what to eat. 

I have tried quite a number of tingkats. Cheaper tingkats tend to taste like (bad) SAF cookhouse food. The more expensive ones will rival Ocean Seafood caipng. 

Personally, I find the Select catering tingkat to be the best compromise between costs, taste and variety.",6,2020-05-02,19:43:48
"Hey! My family has been getting the contact numbers of hawkers and calling to pre-order and takeaway. That may keep costs lower than catering, with more variety. Selara Nasi Lemak at Adams Road is a must 👍🏻

"I tried tingkat services a few weeks ago as a trial. Not bad, a bit like slightly higher-end economic rice (3 dishes + 1 soup), and at about $11 a meal for 2 pax, comparable to buying from outside.  
  
Opted for one-use microwavable containers because lazy to wash the metal tingkat containers.. heh heh  
  
Didn't continue also because variety is the spice of life, and committing to tingkat means that you cannot change your dinner plans abruptly: they need 2-3 days lead-up time if you want to skip a day.",1,2020-05-02,13:19:11
