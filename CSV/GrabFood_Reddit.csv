Please call their customer service. And get them to compensate you with a $10-$20 off for your next order =). Remember need to call them and explain your situation then demand for the compensation.,2019-05-03 20:18:37
"Worst part is if you order food through grab app ( since now they are migrating grab food to main grab app ), until food is delivered you can't even get a cab . Vice versa too, I.e if you are riding a cab you can't order food..


I ordered food from my home for parents and I had to go to a party, guess what I couldn't get a cab till my food was delivered.",2019-05-04 00:07:12
"Update. Food from other service and restaurant at similar distance arrived in less than the 30 minute estimate.

Tbh the only time I use grabfood is when there is a coupon code of macdonald,2019-05-03 21:57:59
"Happened to me once. Ordered McDonalds. Everything goes as per normal within the time frame given. Order received, driver assigned, driver at the restaurant, driver is on the way, then order delivered. I thought, maybe the driver accidentally pressed the “delivered” button on his phone, so I waited 15 more minutes. Still no show. Call the driver, he picked up and said that it’s delivered and he has passed the food to somebody. 
Since I lived in condo, the security has to intercom me whenever there’s any visitor for my unit. So, I went down and asked the security, both the security guard said there’s no food delivery coming in on the last 30 mins. I was hangry. I ordered another food (still with GrabFood, what can I say, I like to collect points) and it arrive safely to me. I don’t even bother calling their customer service. I sent an email to them, they said they’ll investigate and 1 hour later give me a coupon code for $5 or $10 off (can’t rem) and fully refund back my McD purchase.

My guess is the driver ran away with my McD as it’s too tempting to resist. Or, maybe he’s just hungry.
Can’t place the blame fully to Grab tho, sometimes when you’re having an unlucky day, these thing happens.",2019-05-03 23:24:40
Their app update SUCKS. For some goddamn reason they decided to merge it back into the main Grab app and now you can only place one order at a time instead of being able to place several. Godammit.,2019-05-04 01:01:08

"I think you can call and feedback, they may give you some vouchers. Grabfood is a lifesaver for a lazy ass like me. It only failed once for me when there was 50% off Starbucks which took 1 and a half hours to reach. Contrary to your experience, I hate foodpanda because they don’t even let me use their service for some reason. All my orders get cancelled.",2019-05-03 21:07:14
"As someone who is currently signed up to be one of these delivery riders (not grab food, also yet to start working) I've seen quite a few times in the delivery rider chat group, riders complaining that the stall/restaurant is actually closed when they arrive to collect the food. Seems to be quite a common issue, I guess these apps are still pretty buggy...",2019-05-04 10:27:28
"In my experience, Foodpanda takes the cake as the absolute worst service. Delivery is mostly always late, no notifications informing late delivery, food is always all mangled up upon delivery and the most insulting of all, they compensate unfulfilled orders with a $5 coupon with a minimum spend of $25.

Fuuuuuuck that. I deleted Foodpanda ASAP.",2019-05-04 01:47:13

"Disappointed with grabfood too. The app provides a scheduling feature where you choose a timeslot when you will have your food delivered. And I always get my food an hour or more earlier than my reserved slot.  And worse, I am still not at home to receive the order. Ok grab, I get it - you immediately assign my order to a rider. But what is the point of the scheduling feature then? For all these orders, I shared my complains to grab but nothing has changed. Never had these issues with foodpanda or deliveroo.",2019-05-03 22:43:58
"Can relate. 

Happened to me before. The deliverer also switched off his phone. Waited 1 h 30 min in the dark. Got too hungry so decided to eat caipng downstairs.

And the helpline is not very helpful.",2019-05-03 22:54:05

And also grabpay doesnt end in $38.50 its always like $38.73 Like how on earth will I spend 73 cents? Rides are like $13.50 and food is $13.20 Fuck grab i hope they close down",2019-09-15 18:10:45
"Grabfood requires top up to their eWallet, and that's the reason I refused to use it. eWallet promotes impulsive spending as users often want to spend away any remaining credit in their eWallet. Topping up and not using the app would be a waste, hence it's a great ""lock-in"" mechanism for Grabfood to maintain it's user base. Comparing it to Foodpanda, it allows COD, so I never had the urge to overspend, so far the service has been satisfactory.",2019-05-03 22:28:13
"Sounds like you had a pretty crappy experience! I've been lucky in that I've actually had pretty good experiences with Grab Food so far. I've had one time when an item was left out of an order, but I have a feeling it was the restaurant's fault and Grab compensated me for it afterwards. I don't mind using Grab for food and transport cuz I can collect points for discounts later.",2019-05-03 23:43:31
"Two times I ordered GrabFood where they forgot 1 of my order, had to call them and wait 10 minutes due to heavy traffic just to even get a refund. Ridiculous",2019-05-03 23:30:15
"So far, I have been very happy with my experiences with Grabfood. Food is always early, if not on time and the riders have always been very friendly. The one time the order was messed up was due to a mistake by the restaurant - and Grabfood very quickly refunded me the $, although we did have to forego one portion of food. 😬 
These experiences, coupled with their promotions - what is there not to love?",2019-05-03 20:38:20
"same for me.  grab food got cancelled.  and i topped up $20 prior to grabpay.

it's like they planned to have some of my cash in grabpay no matter what.  i still have to use their services in the future or forgo the amount in my grab pay",2019-05-04 22:48:27
To be honest I’ve had more frequent problems with other apps especially DELIVEROO where I ended up getting 4x$10 credits in a single night (yes the same order got fked 4 times). Grab is quite generous with codes if u ask for it anyway,2019-05-04 01:24:15

"I’ve had a similar experience with Foodpanda before, ordered dinner for my event helpers. Food came 45mins late, with several orders wrong/missing. Tried contacting them but their help service was horrible. My takeaway was that these things happen regardless of which service you use; sometimes it just happens. It’s a risk that comes with these food delivery services, regardless of the provider.",2019-05-04 08:07:07

"This actually happened to me before as well but on the other side of your problem. The driver delivered food to my house despite me having no knowledge of ordering food at the time. Turns out, they were delivering to the same numbered unit in the wrong condo as my place has a very similarly named condo right across the road. Happened twice so far, once with Grab and once with McDelivery.",2019-05-04 00:44:25

"I've also had lousy experiences with Foodpanda. Took over 3 hrs for the food to be delivered. I was in contact with them over their online chat from hours 1-3. Called the restaurant directly after 2 hrs and they were still waiting for the driver to pick up. In the end I got food that was prepared over 2hrs beforehand.

They promised me some compensation and to wait for an email from them. I never received an email, still had to pay for the food and so I cancelled my account.

I work as a rider for another food delivery company. There are times too when I receive orders that are to be delivered at a later timing. The problem I think lies with the merchants. Some merchants already prepare the customers’ food even though it was only to be delivered like 45 mins later. So I had no choice but to collect the food and deliver it to the customer.,2019-05-08 02:05:11

Foodpanda also has a free delivery partnership with Lazada that is much more sustainable than Grab's time-limited $15 of vouchers for a 1 month subscription of $7.99 deal. Grab is willing to subsidise in the short term but they're late to the game.

Previously tried the Panda (food always late) and the Roo (high delivery charges) - eventually happily settled on the Grab... not paid by Grab to say any of this (naturally if they see this and would like to offer me more discounts, I will not reject them!) 

Anyway, have been told that some of the delivery services do better in some areas as compared to others - so maybe I just happen to have good Grab services in the area I frequent. 🤗 Have a good evening, every one!",2019-05-03 21:55:46

Clearly with Uber gone, I’m stuck with the other two. Deliveroo wins on customer service but sadly where I live both have pretty minimal restaurant offerings.

">My portfolio performance is I'm in the green for 4 months.

4 months is a short time frame. We have been a bull market for the last 10 years or so, most younger investors have not experienced a bear market. Do this for a longer period before making any drastic changes.

I'm not sure about your portfolio size or Grabfood but 1.5k means that you need to be earning about $18,000/year. Assuming you're getting around the same returns as the DJI historical returns(+/-10%/annum), you would need a portfolio of around $180,000. If Grab provides about half of your income, you would need a portfolio of about $90,000, and this is assuming that

1. You have enough emergency cash through a bear market
2. Portfolio size stays around the same through a bear market.
3. You're able to get similar returns to the index
4. Liquidity isn't an issue
5. Currency risks aren't a concern
6. No other concerns in future. E.g. Health, Significant Other, large purchases
7. No inflation
8. No tax
9. No commissions

"> Medics are allowed (and obligated) to overrule superior officers in situations involving the medical care of soldiers.

I don't know how true this is to be honest. This sounds like those tales that NSFs tell but nobody knows if its legit because its too logical and SAF isn't logical. For example, SAF drivers during my time even if there was an emergency have to keep to the 50KM speed limit. Only with a waiver and approval command by the Vehicle commander can it exceed. 

There was one time some guy got stung badly at murai and had an allergic reaction. So my mate got activated to ambulance him over to the hospital. Had to go through vcom approval etc. Lucky the vcom also scared to get in trouble so just say ok go ahead zoom to hospital. But if the vcom say no, then the driver also lan lan suck thumb stick to 50KM otherwise what the fuck is the point of that protocol?

Ya I know its not a medic but the scenario is very similar, in the event an emergency happens and the standing order is no, what do?",2020-09-26 23:13:56

1. F&B's profit margins (amount earned after all the fees and commission are subtracted which may make it unsustainable for them)

2. Riders' fees and incentives (Not worth for bike riders, hard to earn a decent living after petrol for the motorcyclists)

3. Grab's profit margins (Asking a for-profit company to do that is just not gonna happen because they have a responsibility towards their shareholders too)

4. Customers' spending power (All these problems would disappear if customers was simply willing to pay more but how many can afford to? We can save the F&B stalls by dabao-ing in person but Grab and riders would be shafted and it'd also go against the spirit of current Circuit Breaker measures.

My clients in the F&B industry will complain about grab / food delivery platforms with their predatory tactics.

"Actually from this equation, based on recurring manpower operating cost per stakeholder type:

1. Restaurant (Assume 10 person)
2. Rider (1 person)
3. Platform (Restaurant support, Rider support, Tech (app), Tech (infrastructure), Sales (to get new vendors), photography, restaurant logistics, marketplace management, Operations, Supply chain (for device and equipment), Finance (Billing), Marketing, Data team, Security team etc.

Breakdown of earnings:

1. Restaurant earns $17.55
2. Grab Driver earns $8 (Assume), lets be real, riders won't accept this order unless forced to do so due to the 8km distance, will be grabcar drivers.
3. Delivery app $22.7 - $8 = $14.7

Ultimately in this pricing structure all parties must be agreeable to the model. No one party really gives a shit as long as each other party is able to derive value to sustain their own needs.
  
Shit happens when profit structure prove unsustainable for any one party. Like i mentioned in an earlier post on another thread, riders are the expandable commodity in the current environment.

Restaurants main goal is to tide over this shitshow of Covid lockdown + explore inhouse / contracted delivery.

Platform main goal is to onboard as many restaurants as possible and ensure minimal problems in order assignment to riders/ fulfilment. 

Moral of the story: STAY THE FUCK HOME BECAUSE

1. Restaurants can earn 100% of the profit pie once this situation becomes better to allow walk-ins
2. Grabfood drivers go back to Grabcar so riders get orders
3. Platform goes back to their normal operational levels 

Lastly i would like to add, if possible, restaurants should focus on making dishes that survive better while being delivered and find their competitive edge/ offering against their local competitors (Eg: Introduce sides rather than only selling a protein + carb combo/ see what cuisine type is lacking in the area and make it happen)",2020-04-15 09:26:56

>The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by three customers in the city, alleges that the delivery companies violated U.S. antitrust laws by requiring that the restaurants charge customers the same price for dining in and delivery. The customers have also taken issue with the high commission fee third party services charge restaurants, which they allege can be anywhere from 10 percent to 40 percent of each order.
The lawsuit alleges that these companies — including Seamless, which is owned by Grubhub, and Caviar, which is owned by DoorDash — place restaurants in a tough spot with the commission, and that restaurants in turn are forced to charge customers more to make up for those costs. The higher restaurant prices across the board then drive customers to use third-party services more and potentially drive business away from some restaurants, the lawsuit alleges.",2020-04-15 21:43:54

"Food delivery apps provide a low bar of entry for riders. The apps do simplify the workflow of delivery. You can walk, kickscooter, cycle with an unpowered bike. To work directly with a f&b business, you have to have a minimum of an ebike and have some experience riding. 

Riders are now struggling to get enough orders from customers, and every day more riders come aboard. We need to support these out of work riders and order more from apps. 

Do order from local businesses near your place so riders can have a quick delivery. We're too poor to order food, so idk how to save costs. But you can sign up for multiple accounts in your household to get the various forms of discounted delivery once you run out. Ordering (slightly) before and after peak periods would let riders earn for more hours, reduce their waiting time and the stall's prep time. 

Grab's food delivery service is now subsidising its transport services. Foodpanda and deliveroo should take the lead and follow the example of its American counterparts who are at least doing something. This is their opportunity to gain marketshare against the dominant player. 

The minimum that can be done is deferring commission charges, which isn't ideal as restaurants still have to pay afterwards. Doordash is waiving commission fees for new to platform restaurants for 30 days and takeout fees for all restaurants, as well as halving commission fees for restaurants with 5 or less locations until the end of May.

When you use Grab, you pay for massive overheads. You subsidize other parts of their “empire” that they want to price aggressively to gain market share. You fund their ubiquitous marketing. You pay for the dividends going to the shareholders.

With a non-profit, you could operate the same island-wide service at cost, pay all parties involved (lean back office staff, delivery drivers) a fair wage, and have not an extra penny in overhead (no marketing, no dividends, no ancillary business, etc). The cost to F&B outlets would be considerably less, and any surplus at the end of the year would be reinvested in improving the performance and lowering the cost-to-serve. It would be a win-win for both F&B outlets and consumers.

also to add on, i feel that the use of grab/delivery apps, sorta commodifies the food store. instead of ordering from XXX, it becomes ordering off grab. can't really articulate what's in my head. but i feel that stores end up shoring up grab/delivery app brand instead of their own by using these food delivery services. like they are sacrificing brand identity while at the same time builidng up the food delivery's brand.",2020-04-15 21:21:38

"i think Colin's breakdown shows the exact opposite. As long as restaurants are willing to pick up the tab, food delivery apps who really are just tech middlemen do handsomely well.

It's the classic 1000 small businesses feeding the giant.

However if some event causes restaurants to not have business & shutter, such apps will suffer. 

Unless it goes the current UK model where eateries become pure takeout focused, operating out of container box kitchen parks, some of these container kitchens are run/owned by the food delivery app.",2020-04-15 15:39:46

"Delivery models like grab, foodpanda and deliveroo are inherently unprofitable even at 'scale'. Grubhub, which is more of a food delivery aggregator (drivers are from the restaurants) made this clear in their [investor letter last year](https://s2.q4cdn.com/772508021/files/doc_financials/2019/q3/October-2019-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) that what these companies are doing is just not sustainable in the long term.

The only road to profitability is:

1. Complete market monopoly resulting in raising delivery fees for the customers or the merchants. This may not even be possible as new unprofitable disruptors will just join the market since barriers are low. 
2. Some other way to drastically reduce the cost of delivery: robot delivery or some crazy good route optimization.. but these are all still ages away and come with physical limitations.

My take is that delivery fees will shoot up eventually, and customers will just have to accept it. Either that or they all go bust and get replaced by some new start-up funded with deep pockets.",2020-04-15 14:43:10
"I work for a non-profit association with hundreds of members. Just because it’s an industry association doesn’t mean everyone has a voice. Like every corporate, it has governance mechanisms in place, with a Board, a Chairman, an executive team, various working groups to address technical aspects, etc. The only thing it doesn’t have is a profit motive and shareholders to pay dividends to. It’s sole purpose is to serve its members, and it works very well. Of course its possible.",2020-04-15 19:05:37
"I’m not limiting this to hawkers. I’m talking about a professional app that allows itemized menu posting, order taking, transaction processing, and delivery guidance for drivers. Essentially the same functional scope that Grab, FoodPanda, Deliveroo etc offer. The building blocks (technology-wise) exist in the form of libraries. But if you take away the overhead and dividends, you can turn the economic equation around.

I agree that Grab is a terrible and expansive business model that wants to be everything for everyone and fails at each one. I wrote about it [here](https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/_/fmjw6cz/?context=1).",2020-04-15 12:06:42
Stop being the white knight here. Are you implying there’s no fixed cost incurred by grab for the machines?,2020-04-16 09:38:59
"Yes but grab has to take a cut because they are providing a delivery service for these restaurants no? They take some from the restaurant and some from the customers for the delivery service and then that goes to the Drivers and grab. 

If the restaurant choose to increase price on grab to cover their share of the delivery cost, then everything goes to the customer. 

I have friends with restaurants negotiating lower cuts and then absorbing the cost for delivery orders instead",2020-04-15 09:08:26
"True.

A small eatery near me absorbs the costs and sells at the same price for Grab/physical customers, and all I can say is that their business has been booming since - in this case they're seeing it as gaining NEW customers that otherwise wouldn't have patronised them, instead of seeing it as losing 30% to delivery apps when regular patrons order online instead. 

Can't say it works for everyone, but it certainly worked for their type of cuisine (Mala/Yongtaufoo style pick-and-choose dishes)",2020-04-15 10:54:14

Depends on type of packaging. I’ve seen some real expensive packaging from restaurants.,2020-04-15 09:40:21

I'm saying, it's easy to clone the app, but it's near impossible to scale up. 

That's why even Micky Dee's are on Grabfood now.",2020-04-15 12:59:49
"Most of the companies are making a loss because part of the commissions they are taking from restaurants go to the delivery folks on Top of the delivery fees the customer pay. and they still have to pay for the service they provide which is customer support, driver fleet management etc. 

I don’t see how they are scalping if all this while restaurants are paying this commission.

"Rip 💀 faster faster use now while the vouchers are aplenty, before another uber happens in the food delivery world in SG !!",2020-04-15 14:49:54
"Yes. The issue is marginal cost is high. Each delivery ride is costly especially for perishable goods like meals which have to be delivered in 30 min within ordering - this limits route optimization which often lowers cost. (Ie I can consolidate all orders from ABC restaurant to deliver to Block 123 residents all at once.)

If marginal costs are high and unit economics are fundamentally unprofitable, then scaling WORSENS the problem. Scale only helps if there are high fixed costs and low marginal costs. 

Maybe a complete monopoly may help but honestly I think they either need to have
- high minimum order size 
- high fixed delivery fee 

You see most f&b outlets who are going it alone are doing both. It fundamentally doesn’t make sense for a human being to spend 5-15 min riding to a restaurant and another 5-15 minutes riding to your place to deliver a $10 meal.",2020-04-15 17:56:05
"Non-profit associations are not exactly the same as a non-profit delivery company though. An association represents the interests of its members but does not directly play a prominent role in its members' day to day operations, so even if the association goes belly up it’s no big deal and business as usual for everyone. 

A non-profit delivery company on the other hand directly impacts the bottom line of its members in a huge way so everyone has a lot of skin in the game, and the dynamics are completely different.",2020-04-15 19:14:04
"Exactly. Grab isn't just a delivery service. They are pretty much a POS system in a sense too. Subscribing to Grab pretty much guarantees that your restaurant don't have to manage that part. No need to hire someone who can drive, don't need to plan delivery routes or make a roster.

This costs money so outlets have to mark up their prices to make up for it.",2020-04-15 10:28:04
"Then shouldn't the obvious solution for the suffering restaurant be reducing their packaging costs? 

If OP is only earning $5.55 per order as he claims, clawing back any part of that $1.50 spent on packaging is a big gain.",2020-04-15 11:09:58
"Again, if it's real expensive packaging from **restaurants**, it's probably covered in dish price.

"1. No need to dress up and commute to work - huge plus for me and instantly puts me in a good mood
2. Higher productivity because everyone has to reach me on slack, they can't just pop by my desk to interrupt me
3. My company (foreign scale up - we're about 600-700 worldwide) is super committed in making WFH a success so we have team dedicated to make WFH fun for all - we had a few ""apero"" parties, we zoom during lunch and chitchat, we even have a virtual ""kitchen"" where random coworkers can call in to chitchat. It's nice to still keep the social bond between colleagues. IT and OM team are planning to ship office equipments to those who do not have them at home i.e. monitors, chairs, headset, etc.

I try to force myself to keep to my working hours as much as possible and my family know not to disturb me during those hours. All of my meetings are still going ahead as scheduled; just all online; the main difference is that people are generally not late for online meetings which is a nice plus.

"I feel I have been more productive due to:

1) no travel time means I can start but early (start checking and responding to mails at 8 am)
2) ordering in food or making instant noodles has reduced my lunch time (typically used to utilise the full 1 hr to walk around my office, but now I walk in the evenings instead, given I am at home since morning)
3) on days where I have more work, the 6 pm boundary is not there anymore (from a official office hour perspective). At times I keep working and realise it’s 8 pm, and heck I can, given I have nothing else to do. 

I must tell though that I stay alone and have turned by guest room into a temporary office which makes things easier compared to people with families. On the flip side, humans are supposed to be social. Not having physically met any person (except my maid who comes to clean twice a week, and grab delivery guy 10 second smiles), most of my social interactions are over calls, video meetings, and this has impacted my happiness quotient.

"Worked as a foodpanda cyclist for about 3 months after NS and here are my opinions on foodpanda.
The process for an order are in 3 phases 
1) accepting the order
2) collecting the order
3) delivering the order

We had 15 minutes to collect the order and 15 minutes to deliver. At every process there is always a problem. 

Before even accepting the order the 15 minute timer has already elapsed. The order is already allocated to a Rider, if I as a rider didn’t accept it because I haven’t completed my previous order or whatsoever, the algorithm will send it to another rider. Sometimes there aren’t enough riders , so the wait just continues.

When collecting the order, some places are extremely busy especially at zi char stores. These stores aren’t well equipped or have a system in place for delivery services. Usually they prioritize the customers physically at their store and so the wait continues. Once I waited 1hr for 2 packet of fried rice.

Delivering the order, it’s a matter of following the GPS and just cycling. The only possible fuck up here is if you put your address wrong. The only problem is usually condominiums, sometimes the security system is so fucking annoying requiring you to do 10000 steps and the customer never wants to collect the food from the guard house. And sometimes the security guard is a  cunt.",2019-05-06 18:54:33
"I don't think the problem is with the riders. A majority of people do not fault the riders, the ones that do are assholes. Period.

Foodpanda and their various competitors are the ones at fault here. Setting ridiculous timings for food to be delivered is really asking for complaints to be made. The poor riders, as the face of the deliveries, would eventually pay for this poor managerial decision. 

For example, if one were to go on Foodpanda and order a meal from a foodplace, the app would give an estimate timing of delivery (e.g 20mins). This thing is, the customer would assume that after paying for their food, it would be delivered in 20mins. This is not the case. Foodpanda would firstly have to allocate the rider for the job - this takes time. A lot of it. Meanwhile, the 20mins timer would have already start counting down.

If it takes 15mins for the rider to be allocated, the estimated timing should indicate 35mins, right? Well, Foodpanda does not seem to think so. I have seen this from Grab too. Suggestions to suspend food places does to not seem to be working effectively and efficently. (Only during peak periods, for what I have observed.)

The number 1 place where delivery is seemingly consistent, more often than not, and would always set a benchmark in the food delivery business is non other than Mcdelivery. 

The rest of the industry players really need to improve their delivery processes. The only good thing they have going for them is price.

Normally there’s a timer for every order you receive. Sometimes it’s 13 or 10 mins. Worst is when it’s like -5 mins. It’s probably an order which another rider rejected or something. 

But what’s even worst is when you’re early to pick up the food but the vendor takes like 30 mins to prepare it. Then because of them, we have to rush ourselves. 

A lot of the customers don’t complain when I send them late & I’m thankful. 

Honestly do people think we purposely delay the delivery? We ourselves want to send it as soon as possible. It’s not easy being a delivery rider.",2019-05-06 21:19:05

So guys, sometimes the delivery rider is busy waiting at our counters for your order to be fully cooked & packed while the customers queuing up at our counters are competing for our time, focus & resources too. So this is something that is neither their or companies like FoodPanda's fault.

yesterday when I ordered Pizzas, I was thinking the same. Maybe, for food delivery guys they should have a different system. Normally, they ask him to add his details, the receiver's details, packet details, etc. Instead, they should take a picture of him and ask where he wants to go - the guy can deliver and later while returning he can provide the details. Or the security guard can collect his ID and allow him to deliver first (so the customer gets their food fast and hot, rider gets to reach there on time, and anyhow the details can be filled at security cabin).",2019-05-06 19:43:25

"Quality and consistency matter to most people too. A huge factor why McD is doing wayyyy better than the aforementioned companies even though it costs more. When u allow grab to help u deliver your food, the demand must be damn high.

Edit: forgot put ""even though it costs more""",2019-05-06 18:30:27
Domino's is good! Really support them - think they didn't spend much on ads so the prices are pretty competitive.,2019-05-07 03:19:42
"Tbh McD is still better than a lot of companies’ deliveries, even the ones that have to worry about themselves. I’ve ordered so many times from KFC and it’s always been later than the time given. I’ve tried emailing customer support but they never got back with why they set the timing so early. 

Agreed that McD is different vs Foodpanda and Grabfood, but the time allocated to find a rider should be added into the time given, maybe giving about a generous average time (~15 minutes or so during non-peak hours?) and the actual time food would be delivered. 

There’ll be people who would rather have early/on-time drivers, and hence trust that company more, than one who constantly has drivers not deliver the food ‘on time’ . And when word-of-mouth gets around, plus smart marketing, there’ll be people who switch over. Companies can appear more sympathetic and appreciative towards their drivers like this, which plays on people’s heartstrings and make them think “oh, that’s a company I’d support”.",2019-05-06 17:32:23
"I can see both side's point of view, maybe the first step forward would be that the 20mins delivery time comes with a remark stating it's from when the food leaves the dining establishment, and that there may be extra time needed due to peak hours etc.

Also, being accurate at estimating food at 40mins (example) vs estimating 15mins but taking 40mins... Many would go for the 2nd establishment for the first time, but would likely remember the sour experience (wait so long!) when they want to order for the second time onwards.",2019-05-06 17:25:40
"Oh, how I wished this was true. But it is not. I've tested out this theory a couple of times. Even suggested it via their feedback.  Apparently, the order only goes through to the restaurant once a rider has been assigned. And so, it just a misleading waiting game; You thinking that your food is arriving, Foodpanda waiting to assign it to a rider and the restaurant blissfully unaware that an order had already been made 15mins ago.",2019-05-06 21:36:26

"Happened last week to me, got an order estimated at 25 minutes. Waited for around 30 minutes, then got a notification that the restaurant did not accept my order. Had to re-order from a different restaurant as the original restaurant was no longer available anymore and this order took 30 minutes. This was on a weekend at 4:30pm by the way.

&#x200B;

Like, I understand if a restaurant does not accept an order if they are busy or the food is no longer available. Taking the entire length of my estimated order time to do this, however, is not acceptable by any means. Limit the time where restaurants (or foodpanda themselves) can choose to accept/cancel orders to say, 15 minutes, to make it less frustrating for us.",2019-05-06 18:50:19

Can you point out the part where I said that? 

I said that fasting for health or religious purposes must not be used as an excuse to reduce productivity at the expense of the business. 

Both the employer and employee could of course try to find ways around it (e.g providing snack/power bars to support riders who choose to work through dinnertime without breaking fast) - it is up to them to figure out a win-win solution.

Are clearing trays specifically part of a cleaner's jobs? If they are, of course the cleaners should do their jobs. 

If they are not, then I support raising civic consciousness to help keep hawker places tidy. But which is which? This is a poor example to use btw - it's completely unrelated to the question at hand.",2019-05-06 22:07:59

If u are in a high demand industry then obviously ppl will be willing to pay more to hire u. If u are in some obscure one like say, facilities management then you are gona have to do more to earn the same amount. So which industry are u in? 

Your personal integrity and responsibility towards the things you do also plays a part. Some people is die die 6pm must go home, regardless of whether the office is burning or not, while others will follow thru with their work, even if it lands on their lap at 5.55pm. So what sort of person are u?

For Luck, pretty self explanatory - being the blue eye boy of upper management, always seemingly able to siam arrows and get to close deals + be in charge of very 'PR-able' projects, everything seems to all fall in place for this person. 

There are those who try to manipulate their luck by paying more lip service than doing actual work, especially prominent when u climb higher, so again, where are you right now and how big are your hands(to cup as much balls as you can)? 

There's also this saying: work smart, not work hard. I think when u have unlocked the secrets to this question for your career path, then earning big bucks while going home early with manageable stress is quite easily attainable.

2. Option-2: Explore alternative industries if your industry/domain is dead in SG or there is a glass ceiling for reasons unknown. E2I or Skillsfuture is actually one of the best in the world to expose to diff courses/training. Caution - don't join online sales courses but go with a proper flow. Decide domain - your skills, try few online free stuff then go and join.

"I think Foodpanda has the highest per docket pay among the three companies, but there's no distance incentive. E.g $6.50 per docket regardless of distance travelled. The more you work, the higher you rise through the batch ranking. Lowest is Batch 5. highest is Batch 1. It's like a game, but you grind it out in real life. You gotta have fast fingers if you wanna get your preferred shift timing, or else you'll have to either settle for unpopular slots (graveyard hours) or wait for someone to offer their slots. I do Foodpanda every now and then.

Grabfood, however, has the distance incentive. If I'm not wrong, $5 base per docket, and then you add in the distance and whatever bonus you have. This one can OTOT, but you can only cash out after you hit $50 earnings.

Deliveroo I have no idea, I don't have friends working with them. Should be the same as Grabfood.

You'll have to spend some amount of cash on buying their equipment, which is mandatory, so far I don't see anything regarding the use of second-hand equipment while working for them. I see people use unmarked and unbranded thermal bags, which goes against their guidelines. [Grab will penalize you if you're caught violating their equipment standards.](https://www.grab.com/sg/gfgear/) If you wanna use unbranded bags and not wear the delivery company uniform, at your own risk.

"not sure bout other services (should be the same) but for grab, there's a distance ceiling within which bicycle riders are obliged to travel - any further and we can request dispatch to reassign the order. that probably explains the consecutive cancellations - sometimes the distance on bicycle is just too far, and the time needed to deliver your food to you is going to be very very long, so we'd rather cancel and let dispatch give it to a motorcycle (hopefully) because their distance ceiling is much much higher and they can get your food to you quicker as well.

">  I've taken a fancy to a certain drink that I've ordered every now and then to my house

Does this mean that you used to be able to order it to your house, but couldn't do so on that day?

A simple explaination based on the facts given is as follows:

* Grab wants their delivery ppl to deliver as much as they can
* In order to do so, they need to optimize where and what their delivery workers deliver
* this means they have to take into account several factors, the amount of deliverers available, proximity to the store from the orderer, and the amount of demand on the store
* If any of the above factors are lacking, the delivery time will suffer, resulting in less deliveries
* Grab knows they can somewhat regulate the amount of demand on a store by not taking additional orders if there are too many for the store to handle optimally
* Grab also knows that it is still ok (as less time is wasted) if a delivery driver needs to wait slightly longer for an order if the place they need to deliver to is very close by
* this is why the nearer location can order from that store while the further location (your place) cannot",2019-12-17 21:40:23
"Purely speculating here but Grab obviously wants to optimize for orders every time someone opens the app.

So assuming all stores are available but they only have limited set of screen space to show the available options, they would optimize based on a mix of user distance and popularity of the stores. 

The further a user is from the store, the less likely they are to place an order. Popularity is based on historical data. So there is probably some threshold value your favourite store failed to meet given based on these 2 factors. 

And also explains why it appeared again once your distance to the store shortened, cos the probability of ordering became higher.",2019-12-19 12:50:15
"Hmm just speculating here. Grab makes money off every transaction. Removing a vendor from the list makes it a bad move because it's a potential sale lost. It can't be there vendor refusing to pay grab because as you said they are still willing to deliver next to them. 

Have you tried changing your address to like your neighbor? Does it work?

Maybe because it's a drink the vendor has had complaints about the quality of the drink dropping due to the distance so they reduced the distance?",2019-12-17 20:55:39
"I've also encountered the shorting of delivery radius on some restaurants. 

I've experienced before by selecting a address closer to the restaurant and putting my real address in the notes and I notice whenever I do this it always takes a long time to find riders. Sometimes it even times out and says no rider available.

So I assume grab shortens the delivery radius depending on the number of riders online.",2019-12-17 21:37:44
Perhaps! I mean it is a bubble-tea shop. So most people would only order 1.,2019-12-17 21:48:13
This makes 100% sense. Thanks!,2019-12-17 21:56:50
"Will try this, thanks!",2019-12-17 21:20:06
"Your points are sound, and they essentially relay what the customer service officer told me. It's not so much that the nearer location can order from the store while the further location cannot, as it is the fact that equidistant shops (i.e. in the very same mall) are selectively displayed on the Grab UI. I think your point :  


"" Grab knows they can somewhat regulate the amount of demand on a store by not taking additional orders if there are too many for the store to handle optimally "" addresses this sufficiently. 

I was interested in the exact mechanisms - how does Grab know how busy the store is? Does Grab have insight into the daily operations (non-delivery, actual transactions in physical store) of the vendor?",2019-12-17 21:47:25
Distance isn't a variable in this situation because the stores are located within the same mall. One user commented that the store itself disabled orders on the Grab UI because they were likely overwhelmed with orders. I think that's the most plausible reason!,2019-12-19 13:14:37

"Please don't do that. Us riders get paid by the distance determined by the location you entered in the app, not the one in the notes. It's a really asshole move.",2019-12-17 21:42:33
Riders earn like 5-12 an order depending on distance/availability. By doing this you increase their travelling distance and lengthen their turnovers. I doubt your 2-3 bucks really makes up for that if say it was peak or they had multiple orders. Thereby affecting other customers and by default their ratings. Just takes one rider to report you and they'll ban your account. Don't risk it.,2019-12-17 21:58:51
"Grab probably just takes the demand for the store on their app and extrapolates from there. They probably also take into account times when the stores would generally have increased traffic, i.e, lunch & dinner (although this would probably be equally applied to all stores).

The other point another commenter raised about the profit margins  (to obtain profit margins, Grab would most likely just take the average order $$$ from that store and guess from there) on a small order also makes sense. Its better for Grab to optimize their workers to deliver more costly orders.",2019-12-17 21:53:56

Yup! So yesterday I tried the same thing and it didn't show up for my house nor an address that was nearer to the mall/store.

> SINGAPORE: Over almost three weeks, a 27-year-old man ordered more than S$700 worth of meals from food delivery applications, had them delivered to his neighbours' flats and ate them without making payment.

> For four counts of cheating, with an additional nine charges taken into consideration, Leonard Tan Tong Han was sentenced to seven days' jail on Thursday (Sep 17).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Tan stayed in a 14th-floor flat in Choa Chu Kang, and carried out the deception by having food delivered to his neighbours' flats on the floors just above and below his.

> The court heard that Tan made several food orders on the GrabFood and Foodpanda mobile applications between Feb 25 and Mar 14, with no intention of paying for his orders.

> He selected the ""cash on delivery"" payment option while ordering and before the food arrived, sent messages to the delivery riders telling them to leave the food outside the flat. He also told them he would make payment via PayLah! or PayNow.

> When he saw that the food had arrived, he would go to his neighbours' flats and collect the food from outside the flats. However, he did not make payment for the orders.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> To carry out his scheme, Tan set up multiple accounts on the food delivery apps with fictitious names and random phone numbers so that he could not be subsequently contacted.

> In one of the incidents on Mar 8, Tan ordered food from a restaurant in Gangsa Road via the Foodpanda app, under the fake name ""Sammy Leong"".

> He selected the ""cash on delivery"" option for the S$91.59 order, which he arranged to be delivered to his neighbour's flat on the 13th floor.

> In his order remarks on the application, Tan wrote: ""Leave food above shoe rack ... picking kids up from hospital. Just sms me your paynow number I will paynow and whatsapp you.""

> The delivery rider placed the food on the shoe rack outside Tan's neighbour's flat, sent a photo of the delivery to a number Tan had given him and left.

> DELIVERY RIDER SENSED SOMETHING WAS AMISS

> Tan later picked up the food, but the food delivery rider sensed something was amiss when he received no reply to his photo. He returned to the flat and saw that the food was gone.

> The rider knocked on the door of the flat, but the neighbour told him he had not placed any food delivery orders, adding that there had been similar incidents.

> The rider reported the case to Foodpanda. The neighbour had filed a police report earlier on Feb 25, over two pizza delivery orders that had been sent to his home.

> The total losses sustained by GrabFood and Foodpanda came to S$718.54. Tan has repaid the companies in full.

> The judge allowed Tan to serve his sentence on Oct 1.

> For each charge of cheating, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined or both.

Unfortunately most of the theft and cheating crimes in the Penal Code are property-centric, i.e. they deal with property and not services

Wage theft would not easily fall under those defined offenses in the Penal Code.

There is a regulatory regime under our labour laws, i.e. Employment Act and Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, but MOM enforcement is spotty. It's no secret where our enforcement priorities lies, and it's also no secret that Singapore treats and has long treated migrant workers shabbily.

There is an excellent position paper by HOME about the practice of wage theft and wage exploitation in Singapore - easily googleable. This issue is also somewhat of interest to me, i  volunteered at a migrant worker NGO for a while and witnessed many outrageous/exploitative practices esp by construction companies.",2020-09-18 09:59:44

"Actually i stand corrected. There's a new section 420A([https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr420A-#pr420A-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr420A-#pr420A-)) in the Penal Code which criminalizes fraudulently or dishonestly obtaining services.

This was just amended last year and came into effect in Jan 2020 this year, which does underscore the point that historically, the law was far more concerned about protecting people's property rights (whether tangible or intangible) rather than being cheated of services.

But i think your larger question is what separates a breach of contract (which would result in a civil claim) from a cheating offence (which would result in criminal prosecution).

The mental element of proving fraud or deception is a necessary element for the offence. This is a very high threshold to prove in reality.

In this Grabfood case, the fraudulent and deceptive conduct is clearly borne out, and his intent can be readily inferred from his numerous pattern of past orders.

A one-off failure to pay your SGH medical bill is not likely enough to plausibly give rise to an inference of fraud.

From an enforcement point of view, the police and prosecutors aren't going to sieve through the hundreds of dishonoured transactions everyday to see whether they have a basis of charging someone for an offence or not.",2020-09-18 13:53:01

In your world of logic probably, no one ever argued that he was entitled to do that. The proposition the whole time was that the punishment handled down based on the evidence and circumstances presented was fair and in accordance to the intent of each crime.

"The benefits of discretionary right turns are apparent in low-volume traffic but traffic in one direction is heavy (for example the exit after an expressway to work in the morning), but is almost non-existent when conflicting traffic (including pedestrians crossing) is present. Furthermore, in high volume traffic there is so much information that the driver must process at the same time that I don't think there is a real way to ensure all drivers reach that level of speed of thinking.

Perhaps we should have a system  for traffic lights in box junctions that only allow discretionary right turns when there are no conflicting traffic detected using cameras to detect humans and vehicles.

Well thats the rules. If the cyclist don't follow rule then we all know whos fault it is when accident occur. Road is for cars who simply share with cyclists. Not cyclists share road with cars.

But they seek excitment from cycling on road so they bear the risk. Cycling in park maybe too Gu Niang for them or they think only kids cycle on cycling paths.,2020-08-07 11:45:21

You just need one pissed off driver to cut in front of the cyclist and keep to the extreme left, forcing the cyclist to cycle at a pace dictated by the driver or move into the centre line to overtake and be at higher risk to accidents.

Better infrastructure.

Heck, it's not exactly safe to cycle in parks also. So many goondus walk on cycling lanes. Langah liao whose fault? Cyclists fault again. There's no way around. The weakest link is always us humans, and that is why education and reinforcement is key.

But I can somewhat see Grab perspective. Maximise profits while they are making losses elsewhere. As I understand, their cashcow is more towards food delivery compared to ridehailing. And having such a surplus of riders, definitely does not help the situation. The easy barrier of entry makes the job and deliveries very replaceable, compared to FoodPanda and others.

And to be fair, we part-time delivery riders were never employees of FoodPanda/Grab/Deliveroo. We sign to proxy companies and work as contractors.

"Grab is symptomatic of those startups that have overextended themselves. Just open the app: Food, Mart, Delivery, Insurance, Gift Cards, Subscription, Tickets, Videos, Hotels, and, yes, transport. Cashless payment and a whole grassroots banking system that wants to replace fiat. Social media features and friends messaging. A live blog. Marketing offers from third parties that buy advertising space on the app. It’s a crowded, illegible mess, that exceeds the use case of 99% of its customers.

Its historical core mission (taken over from Uber) is matching the supply and demand for private transport on the island. There’s a legitimate case for the platform being agnostic of *what* is being transported -i.e. it may cater equally to food bags, parcels, or passengers- but it should just focus on serving that purpose *exceptionally* well. That means smart dynamic pricing algorithms, a responsive UI, precise geolocation and routing, an app that learns the travel habits of its customers really well, an awesome matching system, etc.

Instead, it has fallen into the habitual trap of an egomaniac and grandiose vision for a “lifestyle app” that has to be and do everything for everyone. As a result, it does each thing poorly, hurting customer service for both users and delivery partners.

They need a hard reset, or a lot more competition.",2020-04-06 10:09:25

"Biting the bullet to go against the general sentiment of this thread... 

But like another poster mentioned, I believe we've got to understand the bigger picture of how Grab is doing. 

For a long time now, they've been rolling out their food delivery subscription service (it used to be $8 for a $5 & $10 voucher + free 30 deliveries with no minimum cost; think it's now $10 for the same amount for vouchers, but 50 deliveries and $10 min cost - pardon me if I'm mistaken, gave up that habit of grabfooding a while back).

I used to be some of those dudes who would order a $6 meal (I knew a friend who would order a $3.50 bubble teas) and get free delivery. Since Grab pays roughly $6 or more to its riders, and still has to pay the hawker/restaurant, you can imagine the loss they must have incurred during this period of time. 

I believe the main reason behind this move was to take away market share from the other food delivery services like FoodPanda and Deliveroo, by undercutting their profits (most likely taking a loss like what happened with Uber).

So #1 we learnt that Grab's food delivery arm in the Singapore context has probably been incurring losses. 

And #2 is even if food deliveries see a spike, we must be reminded that Grab as a whole is doing poorly in this period of time. 

I've got a friend who's a driver there and boy, there are legit no passengers at all. And that means less profits for Grab too, in the area in which they rely on most.

In response to this, they've allowed drivers to too deliver food, which in turn increases the supply of people delivering food, and as you've mentioned... Supply & demand. 

So yeah, I believe these wage reducing measures were already bound to happen, and the current covid crisis might have simply expedited the process. 

PS. not a grab staff. Actually do not like Grab (felt their price cutting measures were too mean for my lack of business acumen mind) as I used to ride for food panda but I thought an objective opinion should be shared. 

On a more important note - stay safe and sane, everyone!",2020-04-06 09:33:03

It’s not much, but just a small way to say thanks and cheer y’all on for continuing to provide us consumers with this much-needed service despite the trying times.

"Grab is actually losing money on a per-order basis, (as are Deliveroo and FoodPanda)

"i really think it’s high time Singapore does something to revamp the entire food delivery system. we are so far behind compared to China (I’m not being biased or bootlicking, it comes from experience because I am studying in Shanghai). in China, there are 2 apps available: eleme 饿了么 and meituan 美团, and taking out food using these apps is considered the norm. delivery is cheap and fast and there is a wide variety of food available, with frequent discounts and membership offers. the differences between how SG and China operate the system are probably due to the fact that our deliverymen are not as mobile compared to Chinese ones, Chinese riders usually use large e-scooters we call 电瓶车 which is like an electronic motorbike but far more convenient and speedy. given that our traffic conditions don’t allow for proper bike lanes and such e-scooters are quite dangerous, the speed of our deliverymen gets affected. also we just don’t have so many riders compared to China. 

and while supermarket delivery is the norm in China, the apps also offer medicine/flowers/immediate parcel delivery services. i think there’s so much more to be learnt and revamped on the sg side, it shocks me to see that all the problems still exist till now even though Grab, Deliveroo and foodpanda have been here for some time alr. i get that the situation in both countries definitely differ, but i still gape at the exorbitant price that doesn’t translate to riders’ wages and smooth wide coverage of services.",2020-04-06 08:09:56

"Tried grabfood as a mirco time job between uni, its OTOT nature was pretty good for me, started in July, felt like during that time it was pretty fair, but as time goes on I've noticed incentives were completely dropped or halved.

Their driver support is 50/50, sometime you luck out get the support/compensation you need,  sometimes they tell you tough luck. 

Their payout, I guess on weekends are decent, above the standard $10/H ranging about $15 onwards but it has been reduced every few months I noticed, another draw back is your work hours is limited to when people are looking for food (lunch/dinner). 

I agree it's not the nicest job to have, but I'm of the opinion it shouldn't be your full time job, just something to earn some change while looking for a job or while schooling. However, met drivers that relys on grab/panda, felt they always get screwed the most.",2020-04-06 09:47:41

Growing revenue without positive unit economics is still acceptable is a good economy (banks are willing to lend and money can be raised by showing growth). Since future funding might be uncertain now, Grab would need to be more careful about burning its current funds. The adjustments are just Grab trying to make the unit economics less negative, reducing the burn rate. 

It doesn't look like it, but if they are running on negative unit economics, then they are indeed being responsible to the riders by doing this, rather than risk going out of business because they couldn't raise the money to continue.",2020-04-06 10:13:09

"Hi everyone, thanks for all the responses! Very heartened to see the care for our rider community. I'll address some of the more popular queries here:

- Who treats their partners better?

I have accounts with Grabfood and Deliveroo, and my close friend works for Foodpanda, so here's what I know:

Foodpanda - Fixed rate for deliveries, and the rate is quite fair (not the highest though) considering that your rider doesn't know your address until they've picked up your food (similar to Uber back in those days) - can be a good thing, can be a bad thing. But foodpanda dispatch is atrocious - if you thought their customer-facing support channels were bad, wait till you see their rider support. My friend had a job cancelled a week ago by accident after calling rider support to ask for cash reimbursement (customer made a cash order but noshow). Rider support still hasn't reimbursed him the trip fare or the cash portion of the food. Their tiering system also pits riders against each other - highest tier riders get paid more and can book slots early.

Deliveroo - By far the best company, if only they had better demand. Trips are more fairly compensated (they add our journey to the restaurant as part of the fare, Grab doesn't pay for distance to restaurant). Rider support is generally more friendly and knows what's going on. Policies are more reasonable. But their demand is trash - where I live, I can turn on Deliveroo for an entire day and get crickets.

Grab - Their flexibility is a huge bonus compared to the other 2. Things used to be good, getting worse by the day. One more incident comes to mind - they tried to get unsuspecting riders to ""upgrade"" their cash wallet, and when those riders cashed out, their earnings went into their Grabpay account (the one on the consumer app), not their bank account. Just like that, hard-earned money stuck with Grab. Absolutely scummy move in my opinion

- On Grab's balance sheet issues.

No doubt Grab is still making losses, but that isn't really my point. For a company that keeps putting out PR on helping partners and the community and all, I'm surprised they never thought about the optics of cutting rider pay during this time. If this was done any other time (pre-Covid), I don't think it would be such a problem. But in a time when Grab is actively trying to champion riders and drivers as ""essential to our community"" their act of lowering pay sure runs against that messaging.

It's telling to know that I'm not the only rider/driver/employee under Grab who feels this way. Hopefully they'll do something about it eventually.

Keep the comments coming, and stay safe y'all!

EDIT: If you're comfortable going out to dabao, do consider paying your neighborhood hawkers a visit! Buying directly from them means they earn more (cos no need to pay delivery commissions). Help keep them open during these tough times!",2020-04-06 11:07:52

It's quite sad to see a fall from grace like this and all I could do when using the app is tip the drivers and delivery person. Unfortunately it isn't enough",2020-04-06 13:22:39

"Being a Grab driver, I’ve understood so well how they work. Their PR is always to benefit the community. Their tactic is always to throw money to lowball their competitors away. When given the chance to monopolise, the first group of ppl to cut is their drivers. In this case riders. Once upon a time, drivers pay 20% commissions to drivers. But suddenly, if u pick and choose, drivers need to pay 30%. Do again, pay 40%. It was the biggest outcry done by drivers. Cos it goes against the concept of us being their partners. We do the job, we pay 20%. That should be it. This is veering towards modern slavery. 

After that feeble attempt and also me being banned on their platform, they reversed on that change. And can you believe it, I was banned for being vocal about it. So for riders, it’s simple, stop supporting grab. Those ordering food, stop ordering from grab. 

Now, here’s the next problem. Ppl need money. Some don’t care about all these principles. Though some riders will stop using grab, many others will still do it. And that’s why grab will still keep on growing bigger and bigger. Cut the pay, and still ppl do. Kpk, still got ppl do. They learn from their experiences in dealing with Singapore drivers. That’s why they make subtle changes. This won’t be the end. It will keep changing to benefit them until they can make money off riders and their customers. And that’s their end games. Customers having no choice to buy through them. And riders having no choice but to be their slaves.",2020-04-06 13:39:46

Im absolutely confident thats not the case for us cyclists and walkers because we cant afford to keep going unreasonable distances whenever the app fucks up. If its the case for motorcyclists, sure, apply it to them, and not across the board, which affects those who are already struggling to hit their hard earned incentives. Tbh, i see this more as an excuse not to give these payouts to their riders even though we have been working tirelessly to deliver and hit that incentive they have been promising.

>Commission Fees from merchants on GrabFood  
As far as we know, there have been no plans to increase commission fees during this period. We would appreciate it if you could let us know the name of the merchant so that we can take a look and check internally on this.  
  
>  
>Platform Fee:  
We made the announcement on the 12th of March, through an in-app message under the subject title ‘Service fees for GrabFood deliveries’. The feature is currently being rolled out to all users progressively.  
  
>  
>About that Reddit thread about GrabFood:  
Allow us to clarify that we did not cut the base fare for our delivery-partners. What happened to the delivery-partners over the weekend was a bug that has since been fixed on Saturday evening. As of writing, all the deliver-partners have been compensated accordingly for their work.  
Grocery Vouchers deducted from driver-partners wallet  
There was no secret deduction of any sort. What you and your reader have described is the Shop Now Pay Later programme that we rolled out to some of our driver-partners. This is a voucher financing scheme that lets our driver-partners purchase grocery vouchers upfront from us which they can repay over 13 weeks. This mechanic was made clear to driver-partners when they chose to opt-in for the programme.

"Question for OP:'

* Without incentives/ reduction of distances will you still consider delivering food w/ GF?

* Has any restaurant partner shared if their comm structure have decreased due to Covid?

* Has the increased distance of delivery affected your earnings eg: before distance increase u earn $X per week on average, now u earn $Y on average

Considering right now 3 low level moving parts in this business (GF):

* Rider (No issue on supply, if you don't want to do someone else will based on current market conditions)
* Restaurant (Business heavily impacted due to takeaway only, earnings 50% or even lower currently before 7/4 dine in ban)
* Customer (Increasing in order, ideally order volume grows in tandem to supply growth for motor vehicles)

The platform will definitely try its best not to ""temp offline"" due to supply shortages as it impacts restaurants ability to receive orders and further impact their earnings, which results in less money from commissions to sustain it's supply base.

Currently out of the 3 parts mentioned above, riders have the most bandwidth in terms of stretching to ensure sustainability of the food delivery ecosystem in which many restaurants will be forced to shut down earlier if pressure is not alleviated on their end.

* Platform needs to be sustainable for restaurants to get orders
* Restaurants as of today Definitely need orders/ delivery else no need for riders or platform if it goes belly up
* Riders are the commodity needed to deliver the food

Sucks that riders get the short end of the stick here, but as consumers have you ordered from D'Roo/ Foodpanda? Competition only occurs when customers allow it to happen by supporting the other players in the market.",2020-04-06 10:06:42

Similar to many businesses, companies are cutting costs on areas that generate the main bulk of revenue on them, whether be it reduced/same/increased levels of profit so that they can use it to cover for the ailing side of the business. 

An example would be a hotel my friend is working at. He works at the bar in the hotel. Business is booming since covid, but due to the hotel occupancy rate taking a huge hit; they cut their part timers off even though the number of customers coming in has increased. It’s the same for grab, when I converse with the drivers once in a while, they told me that they are barely covering the costs of car rental, let alone making ends meet even before the circuit breaker.

Also, they realised that even with the increase in demand in orders, they can cut the earnings from their riders simply because too many people just want to get a job at this point with low demands from them.

The combination of both would mean that there’s no reason why any businesses facing this would not act the same way as Grab, especially when they operate under the venture capitalist model.",2020-04-06 08:08:24

"Ok fine, if Grab wants to play this game:

- Base fees:

Yes they absolutely decreased base fees. Any rider who's been working for at least a month can attest to that. Notwithstanding the fact that there was a glitch in fares on Saturday, every rider here has concrete proof that fares have dropped - on my side, I have a 0.98km trip which I completed on 23 Mar - I was paid $4.80 for that delivery. I completed another delivery on 5 Apr which was 1.04km, and I was paid $4.70 for that trip. Both trips happened in the same zone, starting from the exact same merchant. I don't know what Grab's definition of ""cut the base fare"" is, but any primary schooler can tell you that $4.80 > $4.70, and 0.98km < 1.04km - essentially, I travelled a longer distance and got paid less. If you're interested to see the screenshots of the 2 trips, drop me a PM and I'll be more than happy to share it with you.

I can't believe Grab is still trying to lie to people when we riders have black and white proof that fares have dropped.

EDIT - more evidence: I did a trip on 1.21km trip on 21 Mar for $4.90. On Tuesday (7 Apr), I did a 1.41km trip for $4.70. Today (9 Apr), I did a 1.52km trip for $4.80. P sure that's also a drop.",2020-04-09 19:57:54
"Not OP, but am part time/weekend grab cyclist for grabfood.

*- Without incentives/ reduction of distances will you still consider delivering food w/ GF?*

Unfortunately yes, because it is tough to find a job that grants this amount of flexiblity. The pay is not the best - but incentives really pushed you to do more orders and distances being >4km is a major gripe for me. Fucked up my knees doing all those uphill end of the world orders. 

- *Has any restaurant partner shared if their comm structure have decreased due to Covid?*

No contact with restaurant partners - communications and price setting between them and grab I believe are on an individual agreement basis. Someone more informed can correct me.

- *Has the increased distance of delivery affected your earnings eg: before distance increase u earn $X per week on average, now u earn $Y on average*

Yes, on average the payout is about 10 dollars lesser a day. (short) Orders that used to pay a minimum of 5 now pay about 4.5. (long) Orders that used to pay ~6.5 now pay about 5.9/6. This multiplied by 12 and reduction of incentives ($10 for 12 deliveries) makes us lose about ~$20 a day from the changes. Imagine working full time, this is significant (20*30 assuming working whole month at *minimum* orders is 600 dollars dip in earnings.",2020-04-06 11:22:36
"Quite an appropriate flair considering your questions haha

1. Incentives make up a large part of our pay (I'd daresay more than 30% based on my earnings), so if Grab completely removes incentives without raising base pay, I suspect there'll be a exodus of riders. As for distance reductions, it's really a suck thumb thing for us - damned if we do (customer complain food cold), damned if we don't (incentives affected).

2. I haven't heard any restaurant mention decreased comms.

3. Because our incentives are for per delivery, if I have to travel longer and take longer for each delivery, pay will definitely drop because the increase in base pay from the distance can never cover for the decreased incentive payout.",2020-04-06 11:16:54

"The thing is, in the instance for Grab, hailing services generate the main bulk of their income. Of course they do cut as much costs they can from it, but there is a limit to how much you can cut, and given the current situation in Singapore, they are still facing losses/massive losses. To mitigate some of the losses, there’s where food delivery comes in.

Right now, they are not at a stage where they can aggressively expand market share due to losses incurred. Given the current situation, maintaining status quo on the customer side, given the increasing reliance on food delivery would mean they are generating more revenue without the need to do anything at all. Thus comes cost cutting.

When they decide to lower incentives and potential income for riders, would it mean that they would face a shortage in riders? With the current job situation in Singapore, many people are swarming into transport(grab, taxi) and food delivery sectors. However, the current group of transport drivers are barely covering costs in the first place, thus Grab has stopped accepting new Grab drivers, let alone people not even wanting to enter the industry due to minimal income/potential losses, thus most people are trying to enter food delivery now. Even with reduced incentives, there are more potential riders available right now. Thus they can afford to save costs, yet be able to retain enough riders to cope with increased demand. Thus it would be a sensible approach to cut costs in the area they are profiting from since it won’t/will barely cause any drop in revenue at all.",2020-04-06 10:41:56

But our cut is generally 4 to 6 dollars on average depending on distance. Distance is very important as it determines how long you get between orders as a rider.

For stalls, someone more informed can chime in but their profit margin on food items is adjusted to their preference on the app, after which grab takes commission from them (how this is structured I have zero clue)

Overhead costs for grab probably is high, not going to discount that. So this could play a key part. If they are making losses per order then it makes sense to increase cost, however they could still maintain the same rider earnings, which was the point of this thread.",2020-04-06 12:52:41

"I suspect the same thing may also be happening on the other big boy food delivery apps. I have noticed that certain restaurants and eateries were shown as not open or not taking orders when they obviously are open for business. E.g. walk in take aways. A pity I never thought of checking it out as I always presumed they were refusing due to overwhelming orders.

On the side note, I am glad to say I have not been using Grabfood for like years since I noticed in general they charge more for the food and delivery charges on their website as compared to food panda and deliveroo. The last order I had with Grabfood was to use a voucher for the previous order they screwed up even when the delivery time was outside peak hours.",2020-06-06 13:13:36

For those who dont know how grab food or related businesses work, they try to ""negotiate"" their cut and try to ""suggest"" the price you put up which almost always is a bigger loss to the provider than themselves.

But it is a risky long term strategy. This kind of non-transparent marketing, erodes customers' trust that they're using an objective platform to search the best vendors. It is as if google changes the search result to favor the website that pays google without telling the customers. As far as I know, google and other major online shop still put label to separate their ads with search result.

I think their logarithm is too smart.

It displays the restaurant that 1) can allow them to earn the highest commission fee first, then subsequently I believe they sort it by 2) popularity

So I assume the logarithm groups high potential restaurants (those that many will order and can allow for stack orders) so one driver can come and do the stacked orders at one go.

Whereas maybe OP restaurant is less popular and therefore is not even displayed. Probably they want to channel all possible riders to do stacked orders as compared to using one rider for one order which isn't efficient.",2020-06-06 03:20:44

Eventually with grab charging more for delivery fee at times like this, and canceling customers’ subscription plan silently (glad that I didn’t subscribe to it), I told myself that I am no longer to use Grab service, I would give my money to other services like Gojek, Foodpanda and Deliveroo, just not Grab anymore.",2020-06-06 01:24:26

The algorithm may also hide lower-priced businesses based on prevailing parameters, such as customers and delivery riders availability, to maximize earning potential for the condition.

Even conscientious investors and company officials have to balance between what is ""unethical"" versus having enough to actually make the company work.

Don't believe me? If you have any money in stocks at all, do you know what the companies that you partially own do, and where they draw the line in terms of what is price gouging? If you can't answer that question, you may begin to understand the disjoint the current financial system has, and you may begin to appreciate that you are actually part of the problem.

The max we can select is 20min. Sometimes, there’s a really long queue at the restaurant and some restaurant prioritise walk-in customers. The waiter always tell the riders to wait when the riders tried to rush them. It can be annoying to many riders as it’s their main source of income and waiting means they are wasting their time and not earning any money. 

As a customer, I can also understand that it can be annoying to wait such a long time with an empty stomach. Especially when the estimated time seems to be extending infinitely.

Nowadays, delivery riders are not as “essential” anymore. 

Ordering food is a luxury because you can go out dabao for yourselves instead of paying inflated prices on food and $2-5 of delivery fees. 

Only then you will realise:

why you dabao still need to wait so long. Need to find mall entrances, need to scan QR here and there, + until you see the BBT store queue, you say to yourself you’ll skip this unhealthy drink. Haha.

On your way back, sudden thunderstorm. You decide to hang out for 20minutes at the mall window shop before the rain subside. You run across the blinking green man to save yourself from wasting another 5minutes. Your poorly covered Kopi gets knocked and you encounter spillage. 

You reach home, mummy ask you “boy, ask you help dabao, you go out havoc 1 hour then come back and my Kopi become half cup!”

"I was one of them there at around that time, can confirm it was a shit show. I reach there one of the other riders told me might wait 30mins+. Was planning to wait it out cuz no choice but luckily i got another order from burger king so i decided to do that first and then come back later. And 30mins later i was back, my order was done dk how long ago and all went well. And coincidentally im pretty sure i saw someone with 3 orders when i looked at his screen for a second but forgot the face alr. 

But then can someone tell me how to get compensation from grab for future reference? What am i suppose to screenshot to prove i waited for 30min, and who am i going to send the screenshot to? Also the compensation is around how much if anyone knows?",2020-04-13 16:35:09
"customer pov should be: 

- the riders are on your side. they are working for you — do the physical queuing for you not just the delivery. most riders are very nice, like ask for sauce or special things they do it too, if the restaurant forget. 

- there are some things that are legit riders fault. like if the food was dropped/smashed/spilled, most of the time, i am fine because i dont expect too much from dabao food. but confirm there are karens (sorry idk the local version) who are picky with it, or even complain food not “served” hot. well my mum is one of them. 

only missing item or uncooked food i will complain to grab. 

anyway, customers can also help the situation by flattening the curve. order/eat at off peak timing, do pre orders (not exactly sure how they work). 

for OP case, merchants can be really shitty too. and i think very likely they do not bare much of the cost, or opportunity cost to the whole issue. i dont think the fault lies with grab.",2020-04-13 17:23:24
Have been ordering during offpeak timing (3/4pm) to hopefully help the drivers/ restaurants cope. But feel that the restaurant could have stopped the orders if they felt that they couldn't cope or to notify people earlier that their orders were cancelled. 2.5 hours is a very long wait :( sigh hope that the covid situation improves soon.,2020-04-13 16:35:11
"Grabfood rider here.

What your dad experienced isn't new, but I believe it has never occured at this magnitude before. Grabfood riders have gotten accustomed to the fact that we'll be made to wait at restaurants. A few restaurants are notorious for their long wait times - Chinese casual restaurants (e.g. DTF, Paradise Group, Crystal Jade), Zichar and Western casual restaurants (I'm looking at you Collin's and Pizza Hut). Some other restaurants that come to mind are Jollibee and Srisun. 

Some delays are completely understandable - an order with 15 items or some dish that needs to be made from scratch. In fact most riders are pretty okay with waiting a reasonable amount of time, and it helps when the restaurant communicates to us so we can update the customer. But if I'm waiting there as a rider for 1 prata and you're telling me the wait time is 30min when there's literally no one else in your restaurant, something isn't quite right la (yes this has happened to me before). Likewise here, 1h+ is definitely unacceptable for the customer and the rider.

To Grab management:
This is what happens when you try to shoehorn food delivery into an app designed to assign private hire jobs - you fail to account for the fact that food needs time to be prepared, whereas a passenger doesn't need much time to meet their driver. As a result there isn't any buffer built between assignment to the rider and assignment to the restaurant. In fact, here's the truth - when your Grabfood app tells you ""The merchant is preparing your order, we'll find you a rider soon"", your merchant actually hasn't received the order and hasn't started preparing your food, because Grab needs to assign the order to a rider first before pushing it to the merchant, meaning the rider receives the order before the merchant. That's why I've stepped into some restaurants before and called out my Grabfood order number only to have merchants be taken aback and telling me ""the order literally just got printed out of the device"".

In fact, back in the days when Grabfood and Grabfood Driver were separate apps from the rest of the Grab ecosystem, restaurants would get the order first and they could select how long it would take them to prepare the order (up to a buffer of 30min I believe) and when the buffer time is almost up, Grab would find a rider to pick up the order. Somewhat like the system Foodpanda and Deliveroo use.

But now Grab doesn't care, because they'd rather make their riders wait for the food than to have merchants saying their food is getting cold waiting for a rider - you as the restaurant can always store the food somewhere temperature-appropriate, but we the riders can't be helping you cook your food.

If the old restaurant selecting their prep time system existed today on Grabfood, this DTF clusterf*** would've never happened. But I guess Grab just can't give enough of a shit to us riders and our time to actually implement it.",2020-04-13 21:21:12
[deleted],2020-04-13 16:58:06
As a delivery rider i can confirm that DTF at Nex has always been a little slow with order preps. And now with the telegram chat (for riders) removed it’s actually very difficult to ask for compensation and request for assistance from Grab,2020-04-13 17:28:49
Ordered from DTF Nex today and the order took forever. Tipped the delivery uncle $10 due to the heavy rain but in the midst of collecting and thanking me he mumbled something about how shitty DTF is. Reading this makes me feel even more fucking glad I tipped him.,2020-04-13 22:45:16
"Wall of text but I'm a rider as well.. I feel ya

Grab has really got to put more resources into customer service during this period (both delivery riders/drivers and consumers). I still see them as profiteering by increasing delivery and platform fees.,2020-04-13 16:51:17
"Wife and myself have been ordering grab quite frequently for some time

Be nice to these delivery guys - it's not easy for them too. Especially since they are taking a risk by going to malls/ Hawker centres to collect your food. 

Just a few things we as customers or users of the app can do:

Stop hounding the helpline- asking why is your food taking so long, why is your food cold, etc. I'd imagine that more often than not, it is out of the delivery rider's control.

We have a little stool outside our condo unit - for them to put the food on, so w don't have to make human contact. 

Also tipped all my deliveries 1-3 bucks (not much I know). Send a thank you message when the rider is on the way.",2020-04-13 17:26:00
"Not sure if the store was too busy to temporarily close the status of the store delivery when there was already so much. I remembered last time at my work, unlike FoodPanda and Deliveroo the Grabfood app doesn't allow the store to reject orders unless you close the menu or store hours. Also, glitch sometimes happen. We have closed the FP delivery status  before and even shutdown the phone, to our surprise a deliveryrider appeared and on his phone, it showed that the order was accepted. Switch on the phone to confirm and it did appear. Though it was not our fault, felt really bad when we had to tell him about the glitch and that the food item was also sold out already. The order was also quite a sum from what I remember. It was sad to see the weak smile the deliveryman gave after hearing us. I hope that things will get better for both sides, the staff who have to monitor the delivery and the deliveryman who are collecting the orders.",2020-04-13 17:32:35

"This is an unfortunate situation and i feel bad for your dad. Appreciate him doing his best to work at this tough period. Kudos to him.

Circling back i agree with your point that everyone has some responsibility here.

**Customers** \- Should try to be more patient and appreciative of what these delivery riders are doing for them albeit at a cost/fee.

**Grab** \- Probably takes the most blame because of the poor management and how stingy they are when it comes to compensation as well as support for this entire process. Compensation is well and good but $4 for waits upwards of 2hrs? That's pathetic.

Just to put things into perspective but Foodpanda has managed this much better. Whenever a certain store hit a ceiling of orders, Foodpanda automatically flags the shop as closed to stop taking orders. This way, restaurants are not swamped with orders whilst customers still get their food in a reasonable time. **This is the way it should be done. Learn from them Grab.**

**Restaurants** \- Benefit of doubt that they have no idea how much demand their promotions will cause resulting in manpower shortage. No excuses though to be understaffed and not communication to the riders earlier.",2020-04-13 20:08:25

I dont understand the rationale???, why would you have a restaurant that has takeaway orders as well as delivery orders and understaff them?? the higher management are like deliberately trying to make the 5-10 staff that are working in burger king (no exaggeration, there was no cashier at the BK counter and 1 person was doing all the burger petty while the manager and another guy was doing the burgers and 1 person was just doing drinks..) more stressed as there's no way they can cope with the amount of orders consistently flowing in.. There was a china lady and another customer who were with me but they had been there way before me and had already ordered and somehow, my food was first... and they apparently told the china lady and the other customer that they ""forgot"" their orders.. lol.. yeah everyone is having really bad experiences.. i feel you OP",2020-04-13 19:02:54

"this is what is happening at every restaurant. not only din tai fung.

grab is pushing out the orders since they introduced islandwide delivery. which is causing more havoc at restaurants cos a lot of them are either understaffed or not ready for the influx of orders.

in the end, during peak hrs, u end up waiting at least 30-45min to collect 1 order.

grab shld really put a limit to how many orders a restaurant can take or a restaurant shld have a limit.

i went to putien at kitchener. the table literally had like 15 orders with only 1-2 orders coming out od the kitchen every 10-15min. by the time they settled that 2. another 5 orders were on the table.

so its really messy and unorganised and affects our earnings cos u can only do much.

if u cancel the order on the delivery rider end, it affects ur rating and u either get very far pickups/drop offs or u get no orders due to the oversupply of drivers/riders around.

so yes. this is what is happening outside.",2020-04-14 07:55:29

DTF is one of them. Haha!

But if he want incentive then waiting time is always always been a problem since 2018 when grab started. 

Weekend morning McDonald’s expect 30 mins to 1 hour queue. 

For me I don’t care about incentive. I just do 20-25 orders a day. Which is around $120-$140 take home nett. 

Yeah I lost around $200-$300 incentive per week or $1000+ a month. 

But I happy, at least I don’t need queue up until my blood boil cuz I don’t have patience. Imagine doing this 20 times a day. Kena heart Attack.

"A few tips for Grab & Ding Tai Fung,

1. Riders/Drivers earn a living. Having no **incentives** and waiting more than 30 mins lowers income by -$15 (eg $25-15=$10). 

2. **Timing**. Many riders are out early everyday working more than 12hrs. Every hr counts, if Grab and shops dont recognise it soon, they're gng to lose substantial business to competitors in the long run. 

3. Drivers/Riders **costs** are either affected by petrol or by hrs cycling to and fro between locations. Even tho they may save energy or petrol, there is no income for idle time. 

4. Becos of **COVID-19**, many have chosen Grabfood and are trying to make some income to tide thru smaller bills. Incentives help riders/drivers, with more perks there'll be more people to help with the orders.

5. Lastly, **Restaurants**. Please give some thought to the people picking up food, they're actually yr colleagues from operations. If you don't treat them nicely, they could be the ones advising customers to place future orders elsewhere.  Think abt that, yr marketing efforts could so easily be improved these guys on the ground. 

If you didn't get any of these then I have a strong suggestion, go do delivery for 2 weeks - you'll learn a great deal there and know first hand how tough it is in this isolated environment👌",2020-04-14 00:09:17

What this meant was that we and the kitchen staff are doing our best to rush out earlier orders as soon as possible but those keep piling up, so we say okay,  we will do a batch for grab/deliveroo/panda. 

I can only tell the other group that  they will have to wait additional 30mins at least. Cos I also don't know.

"I mean there’s many way to look at it. If you are just talking about the customer who bought the food (either delivery or on the spot), then defo delivery customers should be waiting longer. 

But the reality is that there are delivery riders who are not paid an hourly wage. If the merchant delays by a little, say 20-30 mins it’s still bearable, but 1.5 hours? How is that justifiable? You can’t possibly keep bringing in orders when you are unable to cope in the kitchen, so better to just stop service altogether temporarily rather that keep everyone waiting. Not doing that until almost an hour later is horrid because that means the delivery rider is going to earn only that much for the time he has waited, because they are not paid by the hours they work, but by the amount they deliver. If all merchants decide to prioritise on the spot takeaways, riders are going to earn pittance.

Better to balance both delivery and takeaway orders by the time they are ordered, and if you find you cannot cope with both, just turn off the app. Or hire more workers so you wouldn’t have to encounter this problem at all",2020-04-13 18:25:39

"It’s not always about incentive. My dad had 3 orders and collected one alr, that meant his app was stuck as he could not go forward or backwards.

"I empathise with ur dad’s circumstance, but honestly I think you’re laying the blame on the merchant a bit thick. From ur account I don’t see any malice from the merchant’s end - they r likely swamped, under strength and perhaps inexperienced (hence did not turn off the app). Frankly surprised that there’s so little empathy for the kitchen staff who were probably stretched to their limit during the lunch hour today. Not to mention they probably had to deal with very angry grab riders too. 

I’m not surprised that the kitchen is understrength - they may have imposed a quota on the number of people who can work in the kitchen as a covid safety measure. It’s been happening in hawker stalls in Food courts too. The solution is not so easy or straightforward like what u r suggesting. 

And there’s a very flawed premise in ur post. “If all merchants decide to prioritise on the spot takeaways, riders are going to earn a pittance”. It is absolutely logical that merchants would prioritise serving customers who have appeared in person to make their orders. Furthermore, these merchants don’t owe grab riders a living. It’s the Grab company and the paying customers who determine the riders’ income. From my POV, the sensible grab rider would have cancelled the orders and just feedbacked to the customers to get food from another place. The grab riders have a choice whether or not they want to stay there and waste away their potential income for the time they spent waiting. Quite ridiculous to blame others for “lost opportunity cost” imho.",2020-04-13 19:13:21

"Quite a lot of assumptions but I’ll address them one by one.

First, at no point in my post did I blame the kitchen or service crew. I even admitted that these people were even overworked and I knew what it feels like as I was working F&B part time until recently. What I did blame was the management or whoever decided it was a good idea to do a promo, with less than the amount of regular staffs, and still serving customers ordering on the spot at the same time. At plenty of instances, even before the half hour mark, many riders communicated, both to the restaurant and Grab, to stop accepting new orders until the current orders were satisfied, which went unheeded. All that resulted was some back and forth as the restaurant called grab and vice versa multiple times talking about God knows what as the orders kept coming in and riders kept arriving too. 

Of course I understand that there might be regulations limiting staffs, but it’s the management to come up with a contingency plan to cope for an increase in demand, not the riders, isn’t it. And if you fail to plan properly, should you not be responsible for whatever shitshow happens next? This is Din Tai Fung we are talking about, not some random cafes new to Grabfood, and even if working crews were inexperienced, surely the management would be familiar and know that making a promo results in increased demand (I doubt this is their first promo). If they failed to plan for this then the onus is on them. 

Secondly, there are issues with cancelling. Sure, they can be rectified, but do you know the average wait time for support staffs? Riders are expected to report things as soon as he can, and if he spends an entire hour calling, the time he waste will be the same as the time he spends waiting at DTF. Unless you get verbal assurance from the support staff, no driver would want to forfeit their earning when they are already at a place and have incurred some costs (even if not time, parking maybe)

And besides, if DTF clearly communicated on the waiting time, it would be more reasonable to expect Drivers to cancel. You can’t keep waffling on an arbitrary number; first they said 30 mins, then they kept extending minutes by minutes, and until 1.5 hrs later cancelled all orders. How are Drivers supposed to advice their customers accurately on the waiting time. Some customers were still willing to wait for 30 mins, but certainly not 1.5 hours. How bad does it look when initially the driver say 30 mins waiting time as per the restaurant’a instructions, and then having to call them back and keep changing every few moments later? I understand DTF does not have a responsibility paying delivery Drivers, but since everyone is working together, it would only be socially responsible to give accurate updates so both customers and riders can both plan for the situation. If you can’t handle just be honest and say you can’t handle, instead of putting a front. FYI, my dad was lucky he left after 1.5 hours, because he could speak Chinese to the Chinese speaking staff. There were many Malay Abangs who were absolutely clueless because there was no communication to them whatsoever on whatever was happening so they stayed even later than him.",2020-04-13 19:53:54
"It's not right for merchants to prioritize walk-in customers just because they're physically there. They're supposed to be completing orders in the sequence they receive them. Look at any fast food restaurant and they way they operate deliveries.

Delivery customers are ultimately customers. If you make the rider wait, the rider will tell the customer that the restaurant is making them wait. The delivery customer starts wondering why this restaurant is taking so long. Customer decides to never order from the restaurant again. Restaurant has lost a customer.

And it's not like Grab riders can just cancel orders as and when we feel like it. If every merchant pulls this on riders and we have to keep cancelling, we become ineligible for incentives. The merchant's problem then becomes our problem in lost income. It's not a simple game of ""cancel and the next merchant will definitely be fast"" - next merchant could be equally slow, or worse, next order could be from the same merchant, and you just end up wasting even more time. Maybe next time you should strike up a conversation with a rider and actually understand what the process and situation is like before assuming we can ""have a choice whether or not they want to stay there and waste away their potential income for the time they spent waiting"" because we don't have that choice.

And yes OP is right, the rider support line is frequently jammed with wait times well in excess of 30min. With this DTF shitshow happening across the island, riders might as well wait it out because who knows if they'll ever get to speak to a dispatcher.

And it's not like if we cancel the order gets cancelled on the customer's end. It just ends up floating to another rider who's gonna go to the restaurant and discover the shitshow and cancel, and the cycle goes on and on and on.

From my experience working in service positions, I can tell u that I would be much more pressured to answer immediately to the angry and inpatient customer who is there in person, rather than the delivery guy who's sitting around scrolling his phone 90% of the time. It's really not a matter of right or wrong or principles; it is a very simple psychological effect. 

>Customer decides to never order from the restaurant again. Restaurant has lost a customer. 

Right and you’ve already answered your own question. It is very very unlikely that every SINGLE merchant faced by a food delivery guy will be so inefficient - because it will hurt their profits too. So your argument about next merchant being equally slow whatsoever, moot. ~~The problem is OP’s dad did not choose to cancel and move on when OP explicitly mentioned that a number of other riders did - in that case, he made the choice to wait that 2.5hr, the “lost opportunity cost” is his to bear. I also don’t think ANY customer would actually want to wait 2.5hr for their lunch, even if it is from DTF. But Idk, don’t see OP addressing this in his post.~~ Edit: OP has clarified that his dad was repeatedly given false assurances that the food would be out soon and all that, so I understand why he did not move on and stand corrected.

Secondly, is it not possible for the rider to just communicate the situation to the customer so that the order doesn’t get recycled to the next rider? So that the customer can make alternative plans? If you, as a grab rider, cancel ur order and don’t bother to communicate the situation to the unknowing customer then I think u r part of the problem. It is highly unlikely that the customer would insist on waiting 2.5hr for their lunch.

Thirdly, you’re putting yourself into a false dilemma here. You always have a choice. I note that you mentioned the trade off for moving on to the next customer is “what if the next merchant is slow ... will affect our incentives”. Like I said, it is not certain that the next merchant will be slow and secondly, it’s not like there are procedural issues barring u from moving on to the next order. You can, perhaps at the risk of making less in terms of incentives. There’s no either or situation here. And I don’t take kindly to your implying that I’m ignorant because (you assume) I haven’t spoken to a grab rider before. This is a platform for people to speak their minds. We don't all need to be experts or delivery guys to comment on OP's post.",2020-04-13 21:07:59
Ah I see thx,2020-04-14 04:27:26
"Just to clarify, 2.5 hours is the total time my dad spent to resolve this issue. He only waited 1.5 hours at the restaurant, while receiving 1/3 of his orders and proceeded to deliver the only order. However, according to him, because the merchant side did not cancel the order (even though they said they could no cope), his app was stuck on the pending offer, for which he could neither go forwards nor backwards. It also meant he could no longer take up new jobs and there was no option to cancel. Other Drivers probably could as they only had one order; my dad collected 1/3 orders so he couldn’t go back. He had to drive to the Grab HQ (after failing to contact support) in order for them to reset his app, wasting even more time, for which the total amount of time spent was around 2.5 hours. Hope this clarifies!

Also I asked him why didn’t he just reject when he was there before the first order was given to him. He told me he didn’t want the order to get passed on to another unsuspecting Grabfood driver who may be older and weaker than he is. Initially he called the customers who still wanted to wait when the waiting time was stipulated to be 30 mins, so he waited with them, unfortunately it did not turn out that way:(",2020-04-13 21:26:08
"You should really try food delivery for a couple days cos you really don't seem to understand what it's really like.

Psychological effect yes I agree. But would you rather I as the rider tell the customer ""the restaurant has decided to prioritize walk ins over your order so be prepared to wait over an hour for your food"" or would you rather tell the walk in customer ""sorry we're preparing food in the sequence we receive orders and there's lots of delivery orders ahead of yours"" which if you're a sensible wait staff you would've already told the walk-in customer before they started ordering unless you want the customer to be angry at you later.

Yes, every single restaurant is jammed during peak hours. Trust me, you can ask any rider and they'll tell you 90% of merchants make you wait during peak hours. And yes, if there's really that many people ordering DTF, I could cancel one DTF order and the next order that jumps out is another DTF order. Once again, ask any rider.

No, the customer cannot cancel the order once a rider has accepted it. No, the rider also cannot cancel the order for the customer. The only people who can do that is the hotline. And if a shitshow like this is going on, you can be guaranteed the hotline will be slammed. No one's gonna get through without ridiculous wait times. So the order can't get cancelled. I can inform the customer all right, but they can't cancel, I can't cancel, then what? The customer can order the another meal yea sure, but the rider can't cancel, so he can't move on to another job y'know? That's lost income. And self-cancellations affect our eligibility for incentives. And self-cancellations just result in the order being assigned to another rider who'll repeat the cycle. Once again, ask any rider.

While there sure aren't any procedural issues stopping us from cancelling the order on our end, would you, as an employee, be willing to take a pay cut because someone else fucked up? I bet not. Same logic here. Restaurant messed up by taking more than they could handle, so why should I as the rider risk losing my incentive because the restaurant messed up? It's not a false dilemma when you're actually put in the situation of deciding whether to cancel and move to the next order to get 20 bucks or lose an incentive worth over 50. Once again, ask any rider.

You're entitled to your opinion here, but what you've said indicates your obvious lack of awareness and knowledge to what a food delivery rider's job is like. If you don't know what our side of the story is like, don't make assumptions on what we can or cannot do. Sure you don't need to be an expert, so that's why there're riders here like me and others to tell people what it's like from our perspective.",2020-04-13 21:37:02

"Could this be because Grab has alrd processed the payment and hence MUST fulfil the order?

The concept of a payment or transaction, is to exchange money for services rendered.

In situations like delivery, the transaction can only be completed by delayed fulfilment. And since payment has already been processed, GrabFood MUST fulfil their role (the reason for payment) which is to pass the order to the third party (BBT shop in this case) to fulfil, and upon that completion, pass to the GrabFood rider to deliver to the payer; thereby completing Grab’s end of the transaction.

Grab should have further control over every step to refund if cannot be completed at various stages, seemingly not built into their platform.

For completeness of argument and to provide my own counter thesis, I would also like to add that while we should all be kind to Grab and understand that such a situation may be unforeseen (we are in unprecedented times after all), this excuse is unacceptable for a company that can build surge pricing but not a way for third parties to manage their own incoming orders.

This specific example is an outlier since there's outrageously high demand for very limited supply with a time limit. How many such scenarios will happen normally? 

And in any case, Grab's GrabFood model will not work in Singapore anyways. Think they're trying to model Russia's Yandex Eats and China's Meituan but Singaporeans' income is less widely distributed as compared to the riders in China/Russia who are usually from rural villages/ex-Soviet countries where they can make do with delivery commissions. Don't even think Grab is profitable in Singapore right now. They're probably more profitable in the other SEA countries.",2020-04-23 10:51:28

Short of staff, promo for the food, all the delivery guys got screwed waiting. Cancel and u get punished. Wait for two hours and your income is down.

Why they chose to make their money queuing 1hr? Its hard work honest living. They could have opted to steal, rob, peddle drugs. All much easier money.

"Used to work and pack for grabfood orders.. I just don't get why it is an auto accept system. I know the delivery system operates according to our operating hours but the only way to not accept order is to pause the delivery. Though pausing is faster, glitches do happen when we want to do so. Due to that, we often had to turn off every single menu item manually. There are times while turning off the menu item, order still comes in. Calling back grab to cancel the order that had food items that we were still trying to close, is very troublesome. I hope this whole ordeal that have been going on the past few days is enough to introduce better changes to the delivery system. If the other two delivery platforms can at least have the accept/reject button, I don't see why grab can't input one.",2020-04-23 10:42:08

Riders get the order BEFORE the merchant. There's no possibility of non-fulfillment.

That's why you always see hoards of Grabfood riders waiting but rarely Foodpanda or Deliveroo. Because the latter 2 only ping riders when the food is close to ready (i.e. the estimated pickup time). Grab pings riders first, and only when the rider has accepted, will they send the order to the merchant.

Just cos some riders go offline after cancelling doesn't mean Grab can't simply pile those cancelled orders onto the riders who're already waiting (and pay them less per trip too). Riders cannot win in a situation like this.",2020-04-23 10:47:53

"Well in my opinion, why is there such a huge dependency on Grab or for it to change their system? Sure, you're right that it has happening more and more in the past few weeks. Their system can always be improved.

But the Grab partners, they had the option of not working with Grab. There's alternatives, or you can just not engage food delivery tech services.

The customers also want the luxury of not queuing, not going to buy food, and want these services at a cheap, affordable price. They don't want to wait too long too.

The grab delivery riders they want to earn income at their own time. They're afraid to cancel orders in fear of their ratings or whatnot.

Everyone is just trying to make a quick buck/live life. And as I've said, Grab probably isn't even profitable yet, especially in the GrabFood aspect. To me it just seems like people hating on other people, yet all are in the same sinking ship. 

Could Grab have an improved system? Yes. But are they purely at fault? If they didn't have a function for partners to not accept orders, couldn't the riders call it an early day or just cancel? What's there to be said about customers who knowingly try to get orders when these vendors are so packed?

I'm just thinking there's lessons to be learnt, and ways we can all improve ourselves on in these situations.

"Haha yeah I know lots of people get duped by the initial screen saying that they're finding a driver and restaurant is preparing your order - that's straight up false. Merchants don't receive an order until riders accept - I've tested this with multiple merchants when I stand at their counter, they don't see the order until I (as a rider) press accept, only then does their orange devide start ringing.

As a Deliveroo rider, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any food. But on Grab, waits above 10min are the norm rather than the exception.

As long as Grab cannot find a driver within 30min at all, they'll cancel your order without the merchant ever receiving said order. I guess it does have an upside - lesser food wastage from not being able to find someone to deliver. And as long as 1 rider has accepted and cancelled, the order will stay in the system forever and they'll find someone to deliver it.

Riders stick with Grabfood only because of flexibility and demand - Foodpanda riders need to book shifts (and get penalised for not attending them), Deliveroo just doesn't seem to be well know by consumers (super low demand on Deliveroo outside of town) and they're restricting hiring - right now Grab is the only one that's freeflow accepting applications, allows riders to online and offline as they please, and has demand from consumers.",2020-04-23 11:10:41

"Yeah but how many apps will test for a pandemic.
Usually they test app load but merchant load has to be determined by them themselves because for all grab knows, this Restaurant has a Super big kitchen with a lot of employees.

"Oh they must have changed it because of the food wastage situation. I remember having an order that couldn’t find a driver and I called the restaurant they said the food is already ready. So I went down to collect it and pay directly, if not quite sad for the restaurant. 

Looks like pros and cons whichever way they go, I would not want the restaurant to start preparing the food only for there to be no drivers as well. Not sure what the middle ground here can be.

Thanks for sharing btw! Sounds like the food delivery companies are all trying out different ways to tackle supply and demand. Time will tell who has the right solution I suppose.",2020-04-23 11:17:20

Again, it's not a failure of the contracting company in these circumstances.",2020-04-23 18:56:45
"Yeah I believe they changed it after integrating Grabfood into their main app - the old merchant app allowed merchant to select their estimated prep time.

A hybrid method would be best imo - during the day when supply of riders is sufficient, the Foodpanda/Deliveroo system of pinging riders near pickup time would be best for efficiency. Late at night (say 11pm-7am) when there's v few riders on the road, the Grab system would ensure someone would collect the order thus cutting down on potential wastage. But that's also the most technically difficult to implement.",2020-04-23 11:22:20

"The calling in issue isn't just me - lots of cyclists had to do this in the past because of the sheer number of out-of-range jobs we were receiving. I know for a fact that if I hadn't called them to reassign these jobs (and I was calling them for at least 30-40/120ish jobs I was receiving in a week, and this happened every single week) I would've never been able to meet the incentive requirement. If 8 weeks of the same thing happening isn't consistent enough to show a trend, I don't know how else to prove it to you.

Like I said, their data is warped because we get to reassign through the operator which doesn't affect our rates. But the wait times to talk to an operator are insane during peak hours. So some of us cancel the order ourselves. If there were no such operator reassignment option, there is no way (and I'm sure every rider will agree) that the average AR/CR would be anywhere near 90/10. They're basing their decision to raise the incentive requirements from 80/20 to 90/10 based on this warped data. So I'd say this isn't a bias on the rider's side.",2020-04-08 17:45:00

"Grab is clearly being obtuse. An average order for 2 pax and above would well take the delivery order beyond $25, as what is shown in the infographic. Sure, they don’t earn much if the order value is too low, but let’s not kid ourselves, how many people order from Grabfood lower than $25 and how many order more than $25? Bearing in mind that they pay the riders roughly the same regardless if the order is $30 or $90, how can Grab make it seem like they are paying the riders a huge share of the 30% commission? 

This clearly a PR stunt for them to deflect the blame and pass the buck to riders, which is absolutely insulting when you have riders doing backbreaking work transporting $90 worth of food (can you imagine having to carry several plastic bags full of food to their vehicles and then to their customer’s house?) 

For huge orders, most of the commission goes to Grab, well enough to make up for the losses for smaller orders. Stop treating riders as expendable objects and maybe you can spend less time and money on such useless PR stunts to enhance your credibility, because these only exposes your exploitation in the food delivery industry and nothing more.",2020-04-17 14:28:06
"While Grab is correct in listing the places the money is going to, the distribution percentages isn't quite accurate - the infographic suggests that anywhere between 25-30% of the total price paid by the customer is going to the rider. Using a standard basket price of $30 to $40 after service fees, Grab is claiming that a rider will receive between $7 to $12 per trip after adding incentives. That's not quite accurate though - $12 a trip is only occasionally achievable on Sundays for long-distance trips and only for motorcycles (EDIT - for a bicycle to get anywhere near $12 on Sunday which is their highest payout day, they'd need to cycle a minimum of 3.5km between restaurant and customer), while the typical average after incentives is somewhere closer to $5-9 (variance due to distance) (EDIT: this assumes the rider even qualifies for incentives to begin with - if not, it could be even lower, around $4.50-7). That's as low as 12%. 

And know that as basket prices go up, the rider's fee doesn't, meaning that as you buy more food items or more expensive food, the rider pie gets smaller, and the Grab pie gets bigger, as your basket value increases. Meaning that 12% figure gets even smaller.

At least have a more to-scale infographic if you really wanna educate people.

EDIT: just remembered that Grab delivery fees charged to the customer scale with distance, so the consumer is bearing any increase the to rider's pay as a result of distance. So Grab's cut actually doesn't decrease just because your rider travels a longer distance. They're not paying more, you are. Not that it's wrong (Grab can't be charging $3 for a 10km delivery), but just remember that not all costs are being absorbed by Grab or are simply being transferred from merchant commissions to the rider, and their pizza chart just becomes even more inaccurate in this case. Grab may receiving is lower % of the total order amount because the customer is bearing a larger portion of the rider's fee in the form of a higher delivery fee, but in absolute terms, Grab isn't receiving any less.

EDIT2: Rider incentives have also been falling in payout amount and they've tightened the requirements to get incentives meaning fewer riders would be getting incentives, so if the rider incentive portion of Grab's commission drops, naturally the portion they get to keep will rise.

EDIT3: Someone else mentioned stacked orders - that's another way Grab can pay riders less. Stacked orders means the per-trip pay drops because not only are base fares lower than x2 for 2 jobs, subsequent stacked trips don't count toward daily incentives, meaning not only is the rider earning a lower base pay (sometimes as much as 25% lesser than if they had done the 2 orders separately), they also forfeit the incentive for 1 job.",2020-04-17 13:29:43

"Ok, as someone who have part time worked (now not, not gonna steal other people rice bowls now, i'm only a student) the chart is heavily skewed, it really depends on a many variables that changes with every order

For example,  the amount of money we receive is entirely dependent on how far the app think the location of the restaurant and customer location is, Starting from a minimum of $4.5 for short range orders (like walking distance) to 7ish (damn far for bicycle), which normally more than the delivery fees. Incentives is entirely dependent on luck, location and type of transport they are using and if the rider even qualify for their incentive schemes.

It gets more complicated once there is stack orders (not gonna touch back to back), during these orders we deliver more than 1 order at the same time, but however we do not get another minimum of 4.5, but rather we might get an average of +$2.5 onwards, the issue with this is that it may increase our wait time for the food to come out, and they do not add to most of the incentive schemes.

&#x200B;

Also, most of the time spent imo is actually waiting for the food to come out from the merchant (now even worse as they are overloaded by the orders)

&#x200B;

Now, just to see if grab is being unfair by taking a bigger cut, actually not really, they are a business after all, i completely understand if the customer looks at their delivery fee and ask WTF this much for that? (counter argument is whole family taking bus more expensive now), but compared to other countries is say that Singapore food delivery fees is pretty fair, is it completely fair? No it isn't, but you'll only hear complains from drivers/customers/merchants that got the unfair end of the spectrum. I'll admit sometimes i do get some jobs and incentives and wonder, Wow, grab is paying my this much for working this much only? 

&#x200B;

Now, for the merchant, is it fair that grab eats 30% of the fees, no, but it's actually the industry standard, Steam (online game service, also take 30% of the sale for most games) they also don't have to deal with the upkeep of the drivers, as the drivers do it themselves. But when an order comes in for 1 cup of bubble tea, how do you split this? assuming the cup cost $4 and the delivery fee is $3. That's only $7 to split between the driver, merchant and grab, 30% of $7 isn't even enough to pay the driver. With means this is grab worst kind of orders to take, however on the other spectrum, a large order is favorable to grab, however if the order is too large the driver can claim $8-10 from grab as a compensation of good will for a large order (basically asking you to take 2 trips, but no real drivers would actually do that, once or bust :P)",2020-04-17 15:56:50

I understand that on normal days, it’s a “may as well” situation for restaurants. Your shop is open, and many of your costs are sunk / fixed in nature (eg: rent, wages, utilities). You still have to pay them regardless of how many portions of food you sell. So while you may earn less via food delivery, it’s better than not earning anything at all, especially during lull periods when your staff is waving away mosquitoes anyways. 

But this falls apart during this CB period when your eat-in / takeaway orders have pretty much dried up. It may not be worth it just to stay open in order to serve Grabfood orders. 

This really only leaves the customer as the last resort, but if you make them bear the full cost of the food delivery, how many people will be willing to order takeaway if the delivery surcharge reaches $10 or more? It would only make sense for extremely large orders, but people who are buying for 2-3 people would simply not feel this is worth it. 

Else, if a restaurant feels it is not profitable to be part of the food delivery network, then maybe the next best option to be opt out, and maybe just close for business during this period?",2020-04-17 14:04:55

"It’s really how the way we see it. Merchant complain they earn peanuts using grabfood. They can choose not to put their menu on grab. GrabFood may helps your business too. 

Let’s take an example, Everyday you passby Pezzo while going to work, you tell yourself, aiya it’s just another pizza shop. Then one day you at home, lazy go down buy food dunno what to eat, open app and saw grab got free delivery/coupon. You try out Pezzo for the first time. Food arrives, you love it. Next time you passby PEZZO, You sure buy from the store already right!

That's why you see fees like $18 for very-long-distance islandwide deliveries. Meaning Grab is now taking the full 30%. VERY convenient fact for them to leave out.",2020-04-17 20:30:17

- Large Order comp has been severely limited now. It's not as easy as you make it sound to get it anymore. You have to be delivering so many items it can't fit in your bag (considering the size of the bag that has to be a lot of food). They're very strict with photo proof now, and more often than not even if the photo proves the order is too huge to deliver they'll refuse to compensate citing ""changes in policy"" and then refuse to disclose what the new policy is. And since it's a goodwill compensation, it could be taken away at any time. Just like the long wait fees that riders/drivers got for the DTF disaster, that's a goodwill fee too and can be taken away any day.",2020-04-17 16:15:34

"Problem is there is no “different” revenue streams since dine-in is no longer allowed, leaving only takeaway and delivery as the only viable revenue stream. The main increase you see in delivery prices is caused by Grab wanting 30% more, not the restaurant. In fact some of the restaurants even offer promotions at their own expenses, meaning they charge you even less than before. If they don’t do promos, Grab will put them at the bottom of the list so by the time people scroll to them the would have already decided on other food to buy.

In such a competitive market, F&b outlets operate on very fine margins and since demand is bound to decrease after price increases, having to pay Grab 30% is really adding salt to their bleeding financial wounds.",2020-04-17 16:17:38
"My friend in fnb told me that they forbid restaurants from raising their prices. To list the food item restaurants must show them the actual menu used in the restaurant. Then a 30% cut is taken out of the restaurant's menu price. This is likely so grab can jack up more on their side. If both sides jack up then grab cannot jack up. 

 On top of that a commission is charged on the user (us), which is why the grab price is higher than menu price. Grab is earning on both sides while squeezing the people doing the work. 

Restaurants have no choice but to do this delivery business but it doesn't mean you should exploit them. Just like dorm operators. Foreign workers have no choice but to live in your dorm but you don't have to exploit them. Its just not ethical but grab seems perfectly fine with it.",2020-04-18 10:10:30

"I agree, instead of all this hidden fee crap, just charge a clear and complete delivery fee to the consumer. People need to realize that if you want a rider to go and pick up food and send it to your doorstep, there is a certain manpower and logistic cost, which you could save by doing it yourself. If it is so inconvenient/tiring/hot to do it yourself, then that's why you pay $$ for someone to do it. And it's wasteful of your money to have one human go and bring back one packet of food for you.

Because in normal day to day, the merchants sales are not heavily comprised of grabfood deliveries and there are walk-ins and conventional takeaways where they are able to keep all their profits to themselves. But now especially with the lowered demand plus the reduction in profit all while their overhead remains largely the same(kitchen staff, electricity, rental etc.) makes this very much tougher on the merchants and it would be good on grab to lower their commisions to allow the merchants to take a bigger piece of pie.",2020-04-17 13:42:11

"Did you even look at the pie for goodness sake? Of the 30% slice that they allocated under Grab commission, they are implying that the riders take up a huge portion of it, leaving a small remainder for operational costs. In other words, they are justifying their high commission rates on paying their riders a huge share, which is a blatant misconception that they are trying to propagate.

However, in truth, the driver’s share is very much less as they earn mostly a flat rate regardless of order value. That means for a $100 order, if Grab takes $30, the driver will take less than 1/3 of the $30, leaving the other $20+ for Grab to profit. How then can Grab cut the pie to make it seem like the rider is taking most of the 30% commission?",2020-04-17 15:55:19
"In normal times yes, the market supply and demand for labour will eventually sort themselves out. So if too many riders walk away, and Grab is being too unfair, they will lose too many riders to be competitive and might have to adjust their wages to attract more riders again. Therefore, people will be happy again and there will be little to no issue.

However in times like these, when labour demand is low (limited delivery jobs) and supply is high (rising unemployment), Grab can easily exploit riders and still not be worried about a shortage of labour. They can deflate wages indefinitely (riders are already reporting a huge loss of income despite increase in demand for food deliveries) without any consequences because the market allows them to do so, since if someone walks away someone else will also walk into the job.

But government intervention exist for a reason, and sometimes intervention in the market is necessary so as to balance the negative externalities that such deflation of wages can bring about (unhappiness, social unrest etc), so if Grab refuses to self regulate, the Govt can come in to regulate (which is why you see all the post asking the Govt to step in)

If you want to know how labour and businesses work, just take an economics class, you’ll see clearer.",2020-04-17 17:00:05
"Fees for riders are the sum of customer's delivery fee + an adjustment from Grab to reach a base fee proportionate to distance travelled. I'm not sure why you decided to use 50% of the delivery fee as rider comms, because in reality it's a lot more complicated than that. But too complicated to get into at 2am in the morning. tldr version is that the rider adjustment comes from a % of merchant comms, not the delivery fee. The % is variable depending on distance travelled and the customer's delivery fee, so can't really pin down on that.

In numerical examples:

Food Subtotal: $30
Delivery Fee: $3
Platform Fe: 20c
Customer pays: $33.20

From this, the restaurant receives 30*70%=$21
Grab initially gets $30.2 (less the $3 going directly to your rider) - $21 = $9.2

Let's say Grab has decided to peg this delivery at $6 after incentives (I'm being quite generous here w $6, most riders who're part time aren't qualifying for incentives to begin with)

Rider pay = $3 (delivery fee) + $3 (adjustment from Grab, this comes from merchant comms)

Grab ends up earning $9.20 - $3 (this is the adjustment given to the rider) = $6.20 which is about 20%.

If the food subtotal increases, Grab's final earnings would also increase in absolute value and in % value since the rider pay doesn't change with quantity of food ordered.",2020-04-18 02:40:08

"Understood. But as a for-profit company, Grab need their own margins and tbh with the promotions/rider incentives I don't think Grab can pump more investor money. They are bleeding money too. Unfortunately today the restaurants need grab as the connecting party between customers and sellers.  Practically speaking, F&B needs to focus on somewhere else (where the higher costs are eating into their margins) than looking at the delivery company.",2020-04-17 16:30:27
"Grab isnt the only game in town. People still use foodpanda fave or phone in. The reason they take the orders is because grab has high market recognition and large user base. Grab is being paid for their user base and exposure.

They can easily list it on their own on some other site. They can even organise their own delivery riders. In fact its their job to convince customere to phone in to get lower price",2020-04-17 22:31:24
"errr..resturants do have other options vs workers who must say in dorms? I may be wrong but I don't think they can rent an HDB?

My family member ran a F&B place for 3-5 years and the biggest problem she faced was with manpower. The place focussed on south Asian community (majority of offices are IT nearby) but it was not allowed to hire a south Asian worker. Ended up getting a Malaysian worker, chef, and cleaners. Rental as usual took half of the costs followed by the cost of goods and employee. The sad part is the customers didn't like the flavours or taste of the food and finally, she got to close that part.  She survived on deliveries for a couple of years before realizing it's not worth her time/investment and closed. 

Lessons learned: Do homework before venturing. Again with 100% hindsight but with proper study, it could have easily found the risks and limitations. 

Grab or Property owner doesn't owe the business anything. Be it in times of trouble or a normal day. The business was still making a small profit thanks to delivery companies and there were no complaints. Things are certainly different today but once again, if Grab charges 30% cut and not happy, move to others. If it doesn't work, then perhaps 30% to grab is worth the extra business ?",2020-04-18 10:41:25

If they want to justify it on their engineers, support staff, fine, but justifying it on the riders is just playing the blame game saying, “oh we have a high commission rate because we pay a lot to the Drivers”, when this is actually not the case.

"In my opinion, a lowered commission would be more of an act of goodwill right now. With the current surge in demand for these food deliveries as everyone is bound to their homes and nobody is allowed to eat in establishments, these companies should not be too negatively affected and could probably afford to lower their profits for this period to help the fnb sector.

Even if we don’t talk about 90 bucks order (maybe 2-3 a day), the majority of orders are between 30-60 bucks. Don’t have to take my word for it, just ask any rider. Average is definitely not 25 bucks unless is just drinks and dessert (minority of orders)",2020-04-18 15:49:39

I've had $0 adjustment, I've also had $3 adjustments, and these happened within the span of a hour. Incentives vary for different locations as well, so a proper analysis is really really hard to do.

If I had to generalise using your info, I'd say the average adjustment for riders is around $1.50-$2, and incentives would probably average out at around $1-2 per order for weekdays and $2-4 per order for weekends (some get lots of incentives, some get none, so this is just very much a ballpark figure).

Given the amount of people queueing, I bet that some of those people who queued are the same people who complained about boomers queueing in supermarkets.

I think as long as people see in the app that it can be ordered, how would they know that theres a surge? The only time they can see is if it says that it is temporarily unavailable. From the consumer viewpoint, as long as the app say can order means no issue. 


You want to get annoyed, look at grab. they designed the system, they maintain the system, they are in charge.

"Knee-jerk reactions should have been expected. People aren't going out to form clusters, they're getting bubble tea independently of other customers. This is pretty much the same as going out to get dinner, except the number of people trying to get the same thing is higher, leading to crowding.

Also, if the government had more foresight, don't you think they should have eased in the restriction rather than just slapped it on without warning? I understand their actions are designed to reduce transmission risks as soon as possible, but the government is every bit as responsible for this. Yes, bubble tea buyers may be irresponsible, but the government, by not anticipating people reacting to the new rules due to FOMO, is every bit as irresponsible.",2020-04-22 22:58:08
"Government gave ample time for F&B industries to adapt to the CB during the first CB. Yet, we have people going into clubs/bars to get drunk on the last day before the CB kicks in. Ok, so you want government to give time to BBT buyers and the stores. What makes you think that the BBT buyers would not crowd around the stores on its last day of operation? Should the government come and knock on everyone's door and tell them to stay the fk home? Government can make all the laws and rules, but if people are not socially responsible to follow them, is it still the government's fault?

Edit: Please lah. If your BBT queue is that long and you still want to queue, you are just being an irresponsible idiot waiting to get Covid-19. If your dinner queue is that long, and you still queued for it, I respect your stomach. But I will be pretty god damn sure I will avoid that stall and choose a stall with lesser queue, You buy dinner to survive, you buy BBT to survive? Priorities a bit off.",2020-04-22 23:09:07

"> # PlayMade apologises to GrabFood rider arrested at Waterway Point: Staff told him it would be a 'f****** long wait'

> Bubble tea chain PlayMade has shared the events of what happened before a GrabFood rider was arrested after causing a scene outside its outlet at Waterway Point on Tuesday evening (Apr 21).

> Stomp earlier reported the 38-year-old man was arrested for public nuisance after the police received a call for assistance at 9.39pm.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> Several videos of the incident, where the man can be seen shouting at one of the shop's staff members, have been circulating online.

> In response to media queries, PlayMade's management issued the following statement on Wednesday afternoon (Apr 22):

> ""Following the announcement of stricter circuit breaker measures yesterday requiring all bubble tea shops to be shut, our outlet at Waterway Point in Punggol Central saw a huge surge in demand both at the store and through our e-commerce platform with Grab.

> ""Our team worked tirelessly to serve customers who queued up at our outlet as well as placed orders online.

> ""At one point at around 8pm, our staff pressed the pause button on the Grab device to stop further online orders from coming in.

> ""Unknown to us, there were already more than a hundred orders in the system waiting to be matched with Grab drivers, as well as orders that would continue to be matched in the one or two minutes after the system was paused.

> ""During this hectic period, while long queues were building up at our store, a Grab driver expressed his impatience at one of our staff and repeatedly demanded to know how long he would have to wait.

> ""Under pressure and out of frustration, our staff responded that if he had to give an estimate, it would be “a f****** long” wait.

> ""The driver reacted angrily and asked our staff for an apology.

> ""Our staff and other colleagues apologised to him and several of them and other customers tried to defuse the situation.

> ""The video of the visibly upset Grab driver confronting and threatening our staff had gone viral on social media.

> ""Contrary to social media chatter,Playmade was not the party that reported the incident to the police.

> ""We have counseled our staff and he is in deep remorse over his uncouth choice of adjective.

> ""We and our staff sincerely apologise to the Grab driver, our customers and other Grab drivers who were inconvenienced by yesterday’s incident.

> ""Playmade remains very appreciative of all Grab drivers who are among the frontline heroes in our fight against Covid-19, putting their health at risk to deliver food and beverages to households all over Singapore during this challenging time.

> ""Post-circuit-breaker period, Playmade will continue to operate omnichannel customer touchpoints and delivery as we want to be able to offer timely service to our customers whenever they need it, wherever they may be.""

"> We will figure this out subconsciously by 3rd year of quarantine.

To me, this is the *new reality*. I've been rattled by a friend's comment saying that everyone is wanting to return back to normalcy, but the fact is, no, it won't. Every day the virus takes on [new facets](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/confusion-seizure-strokes-how-covid-19-may-affect-the-brain) [which are](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-still-don-t-know-if-recovering-from-covid-19-confers-immunity-or-not) [terrifying](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/04/22/asia-pacific/china-early-patients-coronavirus/), and nobody can find answers on how to beat it.

So I am not surprised to see this quarantine lasting this long into the future. I can already see the anxieties on people's faces as the economic, social and ultimately psychological toll, of this quarantine starts to look like a video game scenario, in particular, *The Last of Us*.",2020-04-23 17:12:14

"> # GrabFood customer in S’pore cancels 20 packs of noodles late-night order when ready as he had waited 30 minutes

> A hawker has taken to Facebook to highlight the type of unruly customer she faced and to reveal the ugly side of some people in Singapore who have no qualms making other people’s lives difficult

> Advertisement

> Order of 20 packets late at night

> In her Dec. 29 Facebook post, the woman wrote about how she received a S$110 order for 20 packets of Tomato Ban Mee, which is essentially noodles in tomato soup.

> According to the time stamp on the messages to confirm the order and delivery details with the customer, the bulk order was made past 11pm — when the hawker was low on manpower and would have to take some time to prepare all the food.

> Cancelled

> Despite repeated confirmation with the customer in Woodlands over text that the order will proceed at 11:15pm, the customer eventually still cancelled the bulk order at 11:48pm, and refused to accept the food that had already been prepared.

> Advertisement

> The reason?

> It had taken more than 30 minutes and that was too long.

> To make matters worst, the customer had opted to make payment via cash.

> This meant that the order was prepared despite no money transferred to the hawker, who would then have to absorb the cost of the ingredients and labour, as well as causing a lot of food to be wasted.

> Advertisement

> Problems

> The hawker then laid out the issues with the current food ordering and delivery system, and the problematic attitude of some customers.

> She wrote that two delivery riders had turned down the job of delivering the 20 packets of food, as they simply could not cope with the load.

> As there was no other riders around, the hawker’s fiance went the extra mile of offering to personally deliver the food by driving down to the customer’s location, which was only 3.4km away.

> The drive would have taken about seven minutes.

> To add insult to injury, the preparation of the food took about 20 minutes — a relatively fast prep time for such a large order.

> Customers can be more understanding

> The hawker also wrote that customers have to understand that stalls that remain open overnight and fulfil supper orders are usually understaffed and would need to take a bit more time to get the food ready.

> She also lamented that it is uncalled for and strange that people in Singapore would queue for hours for some fancier food items, but cannot wait for half an hour for their delivery of hawker food late at night.

> In the comments section of the post, the hawker further explained that this was not the first time she has heard of such cancellations, and that accepting cash payments is a constant risk, as hawkers would then have to seek redress and refunds from GrabFood itself, which might take some time.

"Food panda big bag, grab food big bag, both size same same. Height wise, can fit 6 of those containers. Lengthwise, can fit 6 if you put them in a slight staggered formation, 2x3.

Table looks full because vendor scared if he stacks too high, the plastic lid will break on a few containers, leading to finger pointing to him for spillage. Grab gives a spacer to be used to make partitions in the big bag as needed. If say each plastic has 3 containers of the noodles, the grab rider needs to lay 6 bags of 3 noodles in 2x3, put the partition on top, then pop the last 2 noodles on top of the partition along with whatever extras needed like utensils and chilli. The partition will help distribute the load.

"The customer understood it's an estimation, otherwise they would check on its status at 30 minutes sharp, not 30 minutes *plus*. 31 minutes can be considered 30 minutes plus, as is 39 minutes. +- 10 minutes is a reasonable margin for error. 45 minutes would be 1.5x the promised time. That's already ridiculous. The customer could have finished their meal by then if it arrived on time. 

Now if the business didn't over-promise so the customer didn't walk away immediately instead of ordering. If they could just be conservative and said 45 minutes. No one's time would have been wasted. 

1 - Irrelevant. Customer asked for a projected time. Owner failed to deliver. Unless it's their first day of business, they have a good idea how much time it takes for n number of customers.

2 - Then they inform the customer as soon as it occurs and seek their understanding. Check if it's okay if they took a little longer. Being considerate for the customer makes it more likely for the customer to be sympathetic. It's common sense. It's ridiculous of you to expect customers to be understanding without give and take. It's like you think customers' sole purpose in life is to fuel business owners' dreams of success.

3 - That's part of running a business. The staff are human, they need to take a shit once in a while, if the business suddenly can't function in that very normal scenario, they deserve to fail. They should already have systems in place to manage that.

It's the customer's right to cancel if the business fails to deliver, period. The business could refuse business too if the kitchen was too busy. But of course they'll rarely take the hit and instead expect customers to be ""understanding"". Courtesy doesn't factor into that at all.

"Percentage based commission doesn’t make sense for the merchants. E.g let’s assume a 30% commission on a $10 order = $3 for Grab. But if the order is $100 then 25% commission = $25. Grab’s cost doesn’t change at all whether the order is $10 or $100 because it’s still one single rider doing the delivery, so what Grab is doing is losing money on the smaller orders in the hopes that they will have enough big orders to cover their losses. 

One solution is to move away from percentage based to a rate structure such as:
-	$X for orders $10 or below
-	$X*1.3 for orders between $10-$19.99
-	$X*1.6 for orders between $20-$29.99
and so on...

The main problem with delivery is that it’s always a value-losing proposition with small orders because of the disproportionately high percentage of cost to order value. At the same time, the majority of orders are small orders. This is not a problem that can be easily solved.",2020-05-09 10:08:55
"A GrabFood cyclist gets about $5/delivery. So if your delivery fee is $3-4, GrabFood tops up $2-1 of the XX% to the cyclist. So it makes perfect sense they introduced the minimum order value otherwise they would be bleeding for a $5 food order delivery.

They’ve also been adding more “along the way” jobs to delivery so the overall topup gets even lower. 2x typical $5/jobs suddenly becomes 1x $9/2jobs.

A cyclist needs to travel to restaurant A, wait and collect, then restaurant B, wait and collect before delivering to customer A and then customer B or the other way round.",2020-05-09 00:20:29

"Your solution doesn’t seem that much different from a percentage-based commission structure. The cut is still based on the order amount. 

I agree with your analysis that smaller deliveries are not worth it, but look at it this way. Your delivery crew still have to be paid regardless of whether they are working or not. If you set the minimum order limit too high and too few people order, this means your manpower is seriously going under-utilised. 

One solution I can think of is if you can get customers to place their order way in advance, which may then give the company time to consolidate the orders and see how best to deploy their manpower. For example, perhaps the software could identify that 4 of the orders from say, Streats at BPP are going to families living in the same block. One driver could then be instructed to collect them all and deliver them all at one shot, rather than having 4 different people make 4 separate trips. 

This would mean that the company doesn’t need to hire as many delivery people, which may cut down on their costs.",2020-05-09 10:58:10

OTOH, the actual value that GF/FP/Doo bring to the client resto *and* the paying customer is *discovery*, for which I can see paying the current markups — *once.* It would be interesting if one of the bigs were to rebrand themselves as a ""local restaurant discovery service"", admit up front that they take (the current cut) *for the first order*, with 1/3 to 1/2 the cut for subsequent orders from the same customer to the same client. I bet they'd do better than people seem to think. Would it be *enough* better to turn a sustainable profit?

"Optimal route? That is total BS.
It’s more like slotting any additional order nearby and re-sorting the sequence after.

I’ll give you an example:
collect from Dhoby Ghaut, deliver to Somerset.
Then in between, they slot in an another order: collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton..

You would have thought, hey wow, one straight line... optimal! 
BUT their sequence WILL be re-sorted to collect from Dhoby Ghaut, collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton, deliver to Somerset just because you have to collect all your orders first before you start delivering. So if you are the customer waiting at Somerset, good luck to you. And even lagi good luck to you if Orchard is a long waiting queue BBT shop and customer at Newton decides to be pesky and not include their full address or pick up the rider’s call.

PS: it is their guideline to follow the sequence because you are supposed to update the app upon every collection, delivery action. So if suddenly, your delivery is at your door even when you did not receive that auto “your food is on the way” message, it’s most likely because the rider improvised at a risk of not adhering to their guidelines.",2020-05-09 08:36:21

We can crap on the Foodpanda / deliveroo / Grabfood companies all we want, but the key reason why we keep going back to their apps is because they are so easy to use. I open the app, select the food I want, key in my address and make payment. Foodpanda and Deliveroo even support Apple Pay, which meant that for the longest time, I didn’t even need to key in my credit card details. 

It also means that I don’t need to have half a dozen restaurant apps or websites saved on my phone as well. 

If you ask me, it feels wasteful for each restaurant to manage their own delivery crew.

"Yeah, you're right. Web design here seems stuck in the late 1990s, particularly with regard to language support (the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/ws/languages) are probably still the gold standard here).

I also basically agree that having scores of different delivery fleets is wasteful and a business opportunity in its own right. Maybe, if the bigs don't make their payment scheme more sustainable for the restos and ethical for the customers, an association of restaurateurs could organise a cost-neutral delivery system. Order from whatever restaurant you like, either through their app or the association's, and the association's delivery drivers will get your food to your door.

Advantages over the current system:

* Delivery as a cost-neutral (commercial non-profit) service;
* Lower prices to the customer, and the ability for individual restaurants to experiment with their own promotions more than is presently done; and, not least
* Money made here stays here, and isn't spent on servicing the (all international) bigs' debt.

Doing a multilingual Web/phone app with modern tooling isn't as hard as the way most Singapore sites go about it, and so having an independent, *fully local* site/app with broad visibility and uptake would be a much-needed wake-up call to cheap-at-any-cost Singaporean businesses' Web sites.

"> Taiwan has strong manufacturing and their SMEs immediately produced lots of masks for their citizens.

Not just a case of 'immediately produced'. Back in Jan, when Taiwan got news of people having an unknown pneumonia + Chinese citizens snatching up masks and health supplies overseas, they went out to purchase mask-making equipment instead. The tensions across the Taiwan strait meant that Taiwan was very up to date, compared to other countries (minus Japan/US). The government eventually went to all the mask making factories, offered them the machines (for free, on conditions) and offered them extra manpower (their conscripts) to use the machines.

They recently donated 10 million masks to EU, US and other countries. That was less than a day of their production amount. There's also [news that they would be donating to 7-8 ASEAN countries, including Singapore](https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004070012).",2020-04-09 08:28:58

Even when announcing the new attitude towards wearing of masks in public, there was the name drop of WHO and also mention that studies show asymptomatic transmission is likely. The former is an appeal to authority, even though it's quite plain to see that WHO's response in the pandemic is lacking and slow. While the latter, waiting for concrete evidence before taking action is too reactive and slow, when one considers that the cost of the action (everybody mask up, even if not surgical) is relatively low compared to the consequence of the inaction. In other words, a proactive approach of getting everyone to mask up (even with cloth mask), when there's no strong evidence of asymptomatic transmission yet but one can infer that it's possible (for asymptomatic transmission) and that low symptom expressing infected may not wear masks if it's not normalised for everyone to wear it in public, might result in a circuit breaker being unnecessary now.

Many of us guess the same thing ba.

The appeal to international or superpower authority is just intellectually dishonest IMHO. I've seen over the years WHO, CDC and what other countries' say and do being used as a justification for various decisions. However, if one looks clearly, they're often merely cherry picking what backs their choices. Also, if one's choices are grounded in logic and evidence, there's no need to appeal to authority. Appeal to authority here is used to placate the masses, but also as a convenient scapegoat to blame when decisions turn out to be bad in hindsight.

> If they changed their stance early on, there just be a rush of hoarders. We don't want a situation like in the US or UK where the healthcare workers don't have PPE and are having to re-use them or MacGyver up their own plastic protection.

This is actually a moot point. The government controls the supply of surgical masks and rice. Hence, it's not possible for PPE for public healthcare workers or for food for emergency rationing to gone as a result of consumer hoarding.

---

What's important now is for the CB to work so we can regain some normalcy ASAP.

As for the initial misstep regarding masking up in public, it's not something I really want to harp about, to attribute blame or whatever. It is however, something worth analysing, whether it's about government decision making, to the public relying too much on the Govt and hence not go beyond the prescribed recommendations (arguably though, in the initial phase, it was actual active discouragement from wearing masks. Though it was changed later, could the initial strong discouragement have contributed to low mask wearing even when the discouragement advice was dropped?), to the public following the letter but not the spirit of the law etc.",2020-04-09 06:30:08

There is already a shortage of surgical and n95 masks, it's a global issue. That's why they're resorting to giving out reusable cotton masks for regular people even if they're not as effective. 

We don't know how long this pandemic is going to last and we don't know how large is the stockpile of masks. Food isn't really a concern, PPE for healthcare workers is seeing as how many of the big countries are under equipped.

"For WHO, anyone with at least a pea-sized brain and is intellectually honest will see how they screwed up this pandemic as they were so eager to please the CCP. Cannot name a virus after the location? How about Nipah virus, MERS and Spanish flu?

For Taiwan, everybody had the distrust. For HK, their govt is aligned to the CCP and it's the HK people who fought tooth and nail for several preventive measures to be implemented.

For Singapore, our govt is afraid to anger the CCP, so we didn't ban Chinese arrivals until another country started it, or WHO announced something (cannot remember exactly). It's not too bad as the damage done by Chinese visitors was limited.

That our govt behaves in a reactive and not proactive fashion (imo) with regards to the pandemic, is a problem here, compared to HK, because our people trust the Govt compared to the HK people:

- SG: people trust govt + reactive govt = overall reactive response to pandemic
- HK: people distrust govt + CCP aligned govt = overall proactive response to pandemic",2020-04-09 16:38:29

"A little rant for tonight. Just finished doing grabfood for last 8 hours. My experience in the Holland / Clementi / Buona Vista / Bukit Timah area is that most of the tips I got came from hdb folks who lives in 2 room - 4 room flats. They give up to $10 tips each. The worst places to deliver are at commonwealth drive and Bukit Timah seriously.

Folks who lives in landed / condo don't bother giving any tips or say thank you. Especially Holland / Bukit Timah where I haven't gotten a single tip from that two area ever (spend at least 30% time of my daily trips to that area). I don't reject grab orders, they're usually automatically assigned. I might just stop doing Bukit Timah since most of the riders don't like delivering to that area as its freaking far. And returning back to hotspots waste alot of our petrol.

Delivering at night also means we often need to make phone call to customers at their door step. These are cost we have to self-pay (4G/air time).

I'm not begging for tips, but realistically if you want to help riders who are working to get your food to your place timely, it's a nice gesture by giving some tips.

We appreciate drinks or meals too, i get it once every two weeks by luck.",2020-05-16 05:38:11
"Most probably an extra packed order separate from yours. No chance it’s gonna be a defer/redeem later coupon.

More business for the restaurant, a higher commission cut of the higher order value (unless they somehow exclude these special orders in their calculation backend which seems unlikely)

You may ask, why does grab rider prefer to work in their own area? It's because of familiarity. The faster we deliver, the more we earn. Grab doesn't give us a choice to reject to be honest, if we do, we risk chances of not getting the next order.

Clearly we need to ban pedestrians from the footpath.,2019-11-08 12:52:34
"The whole e-scooter ban is honestly not well thought out, band aid solution to the problem. It' been nearly 3/4 years since e-scooters have been around and the best solution the government can come up with is a ban. If say for the past 4 years, the government has linked up the cycling paths between different areas it wouldn't have been as bad and the ban can be considered as fair. But so far Singapore doesn't have the infrastructure to support the ""car-lite"" society that it tries to push a few years back. Have the cycling infrastructure improved these past few years? Most probably. But the real question is, does it look like 4 years of development? Our government likes to pride itself in foresight. Doing difficult work to make sure we progress as a country. It's been less so recently. Like some here, I feel that so far policies thought out are reactive and shows an unwillingness to have an actual discussion or plan.

&#x200B;

I find it amusing that some of my friends are telling delivery riders to blame errant riders instead of the government and pedestrians. On the other hand I have friends who are delivery drivers that blame pedestrians for the current situation. There were already laws banning the modification of e-scooters, there is a speed limit imposed on e-scooters, there is a weight limit and the battery must be certified. Did it work? Obviously not. These guys were already breaking the law. Once the hoo-ha dies down, guess what is going to happen next? These guys will still break the regulation, ride on footpaths, modify their e-scooters and do whatever they want. What is needed is good enforcement or actual licensing/training along with a good deterrent.

&#x200B;

This sudden ban feels like it's a panic ban lack of forethought. Maybe when Japan banned e-scooters on footpaths, our leaders decided to follow despite Japan having better cycling infrastructure overall. Or maybe elections are coming.",2019-11-08 01:54:57
"Yup. Uh... there isn’t a law that prevents this. 

Thing is, it’s my opinion, but pedestrians are pretty... self-entitled and selectively deaf. They tend to crowd on bicycle paths, gardens by the Bay is one example, along with ecp as well. We do ring our bells and stop, we have to, but it doesn’t change that they’re still kind of jerks about it.

Certain parts of the paveway especially when it reaches a road crossing are so dangerous when you have pmds zooming at speeds way above the speed limit behind you. Not to mention the delivery pmd users that zoom at high speeds, grazing pass you from your back. With the ban, I certainly feel safer and don't have to constantly be alert about vehicles coming from behind me.

Think about it operationally, first you need people/cameras screening footpaths, then you need to be able to identify the errant rider or be able to catch up to them, and need to prove that they were going above speed limit. Having a blanket ban makes it much more simple, anyone on PMD on footpath = catch.

Also, Im surprised why you would laugh at people saying to blame the errant riders. I really do feel that the majority of riders are fine, but just that for some reason PMDs attract a lot of entitled riders.",2019-11-08 09:05:33

Due to this the govt instead of raising taxes and risking public backlash, has instead starting taking revenue from everywhere else.

In this tight financial situation, a comprehensive cycling system is just too expensive to implement and to promote.

I think such people could do well if they had a PMA with a longer battery life of a PMD. Maybe the ban can open up this market for PMA manufacturers.,2019-11-18 16:36:34
A PMA would be far more efficient than PMD pushed on footpath. Grabfood has special PWD accounts too which allocate shorter distance deliveries to them. It shouldn't be difficult to hit 2 deliveries per hour with that.,2019-11-18 14:11:02

"From the article:   


>When asked why he doesn’t use a Personal Mobility Aid (PMA) instead, Mr Saire explained that he had tried, but it doesn’t allow him to go far and do many deliveries. Since he has already been using a PMD, he continues to do so, but switches off the power on footpaths and pushes it forward with his foot.

Though if he's manually pushing his PMD now, it seems to even out to the distance he can cover with a PMA since

>he can now only manage 3 to 4 deliveries in a day, down from the usual 10 to 12.",2019-11-18 14:32:24
Why isn't his PMD considered a PMA? Are they afraid people will cut their legs off as a workaround...,2019-11-18 18:55:40
it's the classic lack of willingness to find a solution. he's banging his head on the wall and unwilling to adapt. Hope he gets over it,2019-11-19 16:59:42
He should find other means. Food delivery jobs or their seemingly-good pay isn't going to stay.,2019-11-18 21:56:07
"We implemented laws for it, but no budget to increase enforcer to enforce the laws. Instead of getting more enforcement to slowly let the society acclimatized, they just drop the ban?

A good comparison is smokers. It is safe to say smoking is deadlier than e-scooter, it is also hard to enforce the [prohibition](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/smoking-prohibition/overview), there is also much more vandalism/fire cases due to smoking.

Why no ban for smoking? Because it scooter ban affect less people? Or ultimately just a quick and lazy way because there isn't much profit involved.",2019-11-18 16:01:40
"this is a bad analogy because the people whose lives will be affected by the fossil fuel industry are rich oil tycoons and major shareholders, but the PMD ban affects mostly low income workers and people with disabilities.",2019-11-18 21:12:11

"This is true so you shouldn't be downvoted. The delivery fee that the customer pays is at most $3 yet the rider gets paid a base of $5 per delivery, and if you include incentives it can be up to $10. This won't be sustainable in the long run. Even if you don't ban PMD, the riders earning will drop drastically in the future anyway.",2019-11-18 23:39:52

Well, if you don’t have enough rider and still have the cheek to inflate the price, then you better make sure you can deliver... which many of times their advanced algorithm to surprise their greed. 

**How many times did you update your subscription plan without informing your customers?**

"The fact is that grab and other large delivery companies are getting 25-30% of the cost. No matter how much you spin it, the cost is still there.

&#x200B;

Let's see if this cost is warranted.

The estimated revenue is 590 million SGD. [https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/124/online-food-delivery/singapore](https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/124/online-food-delivery/singapore) in pre-covid time. Another 20% increase when the CB kicks in  [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-food-delivery-platforms-spike-rider-signups--12651732](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-food-delivery-platforms-spike-rider-signups--12651732) . 

This gives the delivery platforms a gross revenue of about 700 million. Now can they cut down on the commission rate? assuming they reduce the rate from 30% to 10% they will still get a revenue of 233 million.

 Grab mention that they want to have a staff size of about 1500 in Singapore [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-29/grab-to-double-singapore-staff-to-3-000-in-latest-expansion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-29/grab-to-double-singapore-staff-to-3-000-in-latest-expansion). Assuming that the revenue is split equally across all 3 players, and ESG is paying 5% of the commission. that means they could afford to pay their employees 77k each",2020-05-11 14:26:47
Your `/s` is warranted. It's so curious how the article is just plastered with Grab logos.,2020-05-11 12:43:08

"Have no qualms with they imposing a 30% platform or service fee, after all they are a business and they need to be generating revenue. 

However, the issue here is, their customer service sucks big time (i.e apologise and case close, over usage of canned response without the regard of context) and they can’t seems to provide a reliable service despite us paying them to do so. (e.g. food arriving unacceptably late, subpar service quality from Grab employees)",2020-05-11 14:27:33

Totally agree that the app and the service itself are not something I would use or recommend. Point was that the restaurant really have nothing to complain about. Setting up a service that provides the same utility as grab food is probably going to cost them more,2020-05-11 15:18:17
"I got read some reviews from Sethlui and Daniel food diary where they added a sentence or 2 that talks about how the food is not up to standard sometimes before quickly going back to praising the place. Can be them nitpicking about noodles/meat too soft/hard or something is a bit bland/dry/wet. When that happens I just assume it means the food is kinda shit and they doing the bare minimum to convey that so they can still get the sponsored article perks. 

Personally I decide which places to go by reading the most negative Google map reviews and intuition lol.

Here is an example with the [Sethlui review of Nam Seng Noodles](https://sethlui.com/nam-seng-noodles-far-east-square-singapore/). While I personally never tried it I see quite a number of Reddit and Google map comments claiming it's overrated. In the review you can see the writer criticising the food a bit. He said the char siew ""was a tad dry"", the wanton mee was ""too simple and plain"" and the hor fun ""wasn’t as strong or musky"". When I see these small lines of criticisms, I basically ignore the fluff praising and consider the reviews as somewhat negative.",2020-05-11 15:30:46
"The ingredient archives are really good. Can tell a lot of effort is put into those articles explaining how to tell apart fish that look similar to each other at first glance, where they come from and how they should taste etc. The durian ones are great too.

But I find the actual food reviews here tend to drag on and on about nostalgia. I remember one review where he went on for so long about history and tradition that he only attributed only a couple of lines to the actual taste of the dish.

I just use his recommendations are a springboard to look up other reviews online.",2020-05-11 23:56:12
"Read this review before and went to try because of it. Defo not worth the trip. Was meh.

You've hit the mark on looking out for the small lines of criticism. When I see those, I steer away already. Even with their glowing reviews, the food may still not be good - what more when there's any negativity in it lol.

The reason for this is because they're scared to criticise openly. For many reasons. One is to maintain good relationships with PR companies for restaurants like u/flappingjellyfish mentioned. Another is that most of these writers are young students on internships. When they go to old institutions like Nam Seng that have been surviving for decades, they're afraid of saying the food's bad because they're afraid of getting slammed by fans of the place or don't have the confidence to claim the food is bad because they think something along the lines of 'There's so many people who like this place! What if it's me who doesn't know how to appreciate the food?'

Smaller bloggers who are independent and (tend to be) older don't beat around the bush. Firstly, because they pay for their own food and don't have PR relationships to maintain. Secondly, they're adults so they don't have second thoughts about speaking their own mind.",2020-05-11 23:49:06

Ordered a meal from them to test it out, and after about 15 or 20 minutes or so, during which it just implies the restaurant is preparing my order and they're just awaiting a driver, it cancels my order saying there's no driver so try again some other time. 

Frankly I was a little surprised as I wasn't expecting this so I called the support team. Here's the gist of the discussion after I told them what happened.

Grab: Ah yes sir, that's a feature.

Me: I'm sorry what? So you're saying it's a feature that you make your customers wait for 20 minutes and then just cancel their order and you tell them to find their own meal from somewhere else?

Grab: Yes sir. It's like the Grab car app.

Me: Okay, but nowhere in your app did it mention this, so it seems quite unfair. 

Grab: It's in the main grab app, so it's the same feature. 

Me: So i'm supposed to know all this? And you're once again agreeing that it is a feature that Grab will cancel my food order. 

Grab: Yes sir. It's peak hour now. Do you wish to dispute that this is a feature? 

Me: Is there anyone more senior I can speak to?

Grab: Please email grab support and we'll get back to you. 

So.... I got my dinner from Deliveroo. Fantastic work GrabFood. And even more stellar work Deliveroo",2019-04-28 19:08:04
Foodpanda and deliveroo is much more reliable,2019-04-29 05:02:06
"This actually happened to me twice already--food ordered and I've been waiting for an hour plus. Finally call the restaurant and they tell me it's cos there's no Grab riders to deliver my food. What the fuck?

Why can't they just assign a rider IMMEDIATELY after an order so I can search for alternatives if there's no rider? As opposed to me waiting for my food + restaurant wasting money preparing the food + Grab having to refund me.",2019-04-29 03:16:54
That engrish tho,2019-04-29 13:48:33
Do you still have to pay for it?,2019-04-28 19:11:41
"This is actually been in place for awhile. The orders are taken before the rider is assigned. After the time for delivery has lapsed, they will refund and cancel your order. 

Always check on your order and make sure a rider is assigned by a reasonable time. If its 45 mins I usually wait half that time for them to appoint a rider. 


Source : has happened to me.",2019-04-28 22:37:59
Off-topic but wanna thank grabfood for feeding me and my family almost $100 worth of free food,2019-04-29 00:12:58
They lose money doing this too. The alternative is waiting 1-2 hour for your cold food.,2019-04-28 19:26:54
"Availability of riders seems to be a bigger issue (especially in SG) than most delivery apps are willing to admit/acknowledge. Faced this issue multiple times with GrabFood and Deliveroo, with orders from restaurants <2km away taking 45+ mins to be delivered. All because they couldn't assign a rider in time. 

&#x200B;

I guess it pretty much boils down to the economics – these apps will prioritise areas with higher order volumes/average order values (which *seems* to be the CBD area, judging by where they're spending a ton of marketing dollars). So I guess us folks outside of the CBD are pretty much resigned to hoping and praying there are riders available once we hit the Order button.

&#x200B;

Coming back to the topic, it's surprising that GrabFood thinks disposing of the order is a viable/sustainable solution (unless they mean the merchant has to *cancel* the order, and the eloquence of their email has us all confused).",2019-04-29 15:23:39
The problem is not them being wasteful. No one can guarantee the food quality if your food is taken by other customers/ different orders.,2019-04-28 20:20:22
Is this GrabFood as well? That seems outright deceptive.,2019-04-28 19:15:56
"I got this! Twice! Was really pissed about it because it's such a basic thing to get wrong ugh. The system is *supposed* to check if the merchant is actually preparing the food after you place the order, but clearly it doesn't.",2019-04-29 00:27:05
[deleted],2019-04-29 08:41:23
"Huh, usually I call and cancel for the customer. The reason is to free up the order slot for new orders, idk how your rider can do other orders when his current order nv completed


Ps, during peak hrs connecting to the company takes much longer as well.",2019-04-29 02:54:35
Have you sent the email?,2019-04-28 22:20:40
🤦‍♂️ woah. That really sucks. Does having a 'super-app' also mean that each service's ineffectiveness is compounded in one app?,2019-04-29 09:18:43
Yeah this has been my experience as well.,2019-04-29 07:25:42
"Foodpanda app does not let you know when the orders are cancelled.  When we checked  the email,  Foodpanda has already issued a refund.  On the app, status is still ""preparing..""",2019-04-29 11:55:22
"> Why can't they just assign a rider IMMEDIATELY after an order so I can search for alternatives if there's no rider?

Commercially it makes a lot of sense. It gives them 20 minutes time to find a driver. If they tell you upfront there's no driver, you'll go to their competitor and it's a missed sale for them. At least that way they can still hold on to your sale and find one. Whether it's user and customer friendly is of course a completely different matter.

The thing I'm more curious about is who's paying for the orders that gets disposed. The restaurant or Grab?",2019-04-29 14:34:34
"No, but you just have to wait for about 20 minutes while they look for a rider. Then they'll just cancel the order and tell you to try again next time.",2019-04-28 19:13:26
That's great to hear ! Was there a particular reason they did that ?,2019-04-29 07:26:09

"I had a friend who ordered Deliveroo, the support called him and said the driver took the food and ran off, he will receive the refund. That was around xmas period.

He didn't mind the refund/cancellation, he just wanted his burger.",2019-04-29 08:54:08
"Yep, i understand peak hours & there are some black sheep in the industry. That's why I don't make a huge fuss out of these incidents.",2019-04-29 10:33:38

Hoo boy that's bad. Did you report this to Grab? And what was their reply?,2019-04-28 19:19:18

"I understand, you just needed to rant on reddit.",2019-04-29 10:38:30
Presumably they start preparing the moment they see an order though. I suppose my bigger gripe is that Grab seems so cavalier about the food wastage.,2019-04-28 23:07:26
"They refund as usual. Sometimes a small voucher. 
Standard copypaste apology reply.",2019-04-28 19:20:09
Yah it’s common sense to require but doesn’t mean the employee at the merchant will follow,2019-04-29 09:18:19

"Doesn't really help when you're starving and now you also don't have anything to eat haha. ah well, they've got billions so what do they care about perceived small things like this.",2019-04-28 19:21:26
"Ya but how does an order get confirmed as ""received"" when the stall not even open yet lol. It just means that their system doesn't have a ""verify order received"" component and they're just bullshitting ppl.",2019-04-29 10:39:32
Hmm that seems to be the implication from their email reply though.,2019-04-28 23:24:12
"Many things could have happened leh,  but most likely the stall use auto accept and didn’t bother to close their stall on the app.

My Friend part time in fnb and they use auto accept cause damn mafan to confirm all one by one.

But you believe what you want to",2019-04-29 10:47:45
"It's like that. You order your food, it gets to the restaurant's Grab app and they prepare it. Rider gets to the shop and picks it up if it's ready. If not, rider waits until shop gives them the order.

Restaurant prepares food no matter if there is or isn't a rider around. Rider only can accept or decline an order pushed to them.",2019-04-29 00:20:39
Then the stall got problem with setting their opening time for 8am when they nv open at 8am and Grab got problem for not verifying. Anyway either or both of them got problem lol,2019-04-29 10:57:32
"Yah yah human error, system can require everything but once people don’t follow too bad. We all make mistakes anyway.

How do you expect grab to verify whether every stall is opened on time everyday man. If one day the stall owner don’t feel like opening then how.",2019-04-29 11:04:59
"Then the least they could do would be to turn auto accept off when they're not open like duh

Waiting for 45minutes only to have the Grab rider call me and ask where the stall is and still get charged for the order until Grab manually refunds it - that's extremely stupid. Their incompetence shouldn't become my problem but they want to make it my problem and waste my time.",2019-04-29 11:10:36

> SINGAPORE - A GrabFood deliveryman was caught on video grabbing a towel hanging outside a Housing Board flat, less than a week after a similar incident.

> ""Grab does not condone such behaviour and will ban delivery partners who are found guilty,"" the spokesman said.

> In a video titled ""Grabfood #grabtowel"" posted to YouTube by user Muhd Ismail, a man wearing a green GrabFood top can be seen walking along a HDB corridor.

> Stopping by a clothes-drying rack, he looks around before lifting a blue towel and walking back towards what appears to be the lift landing for the floor.

> The video's timestamp indicates the incident happened around 1.30am on Tuesday.

> This is the second such incident reported involving staff from the food delivery service in less than a week.

> SINGAPORE - Customers should be prepared for longer waits and even having their orders cancelled when a ban on the use of electric scooters on public footpaths kicks in on Tuesday (Nov 5), said food delivery provider Grabfood.

> Grab's Grabfood is one of the three major food delivery companies in Singapore, alongside Foodpanda and Deliveroo.

> In response to queries from The Straits Times, Grab said that more than one in three of its delivery riders rely on e-scooters to carry out their jobs.

> ""With the new direction, affected partners will have to consider other modes of transport, which may not be readily available to them,"" a Grab spokesman said.

> ""During this period, we would like to seek consumers' understanding that they may have to wait longer for their orders or may experience an increase in cancellations by delivery-partners who may not be able to cover the delivery distance on foot,"" she added.

> There are about 7,000 food delivery riders in Singapore who use e-scooters, the majority believed to be working for Grab.

> The firm told ST that it respects the decision made by the authorities but will engage the Government in further dialogue to see if it would be possible to allow riders who have displayed responsible riding behaviours to continue using their e-scooters under certain conditions.

> Grab will reach out to all affected riders by the end of the week.

> Meanwhile, Deliveroo told ST that it will stop working with errant riders who continue to use their e-scooters on footpaths.

> A spokesman said: ""We anticipate minimal impact to customers' deliveries, given that personal mobility device (PMD) and power-assisted bicycle riders currently constitute 5 per cent of our overall fleet of 6,000 riders.""

> Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min, who announced the tougher regulations in Parliament on Monday, said that the authorities will work with Workforce Singapore (WSG) to help riders who may need to find new jobs as result of the ban.

> In a statement, WSG said it has a range of programmes and services to help Singaporeans in their job search, ""including those who may be affected by this announcement such as food delivery riders who use e-scooters as their main form of transportation"".

> Mr Richard Lim, WSG's director of career services division added: ""Jobs eekers can also tap WSG's MyCareersFuture.sg, a smart job search portal that can match individuals to relevant jobs based on their skills, including jobs in adjacent sectors or industries.""

> The surveillance footage, shared by Facebook user Grace Lim on Thursday (June 27), had garnered more than 26,000 views and 1,000 shares by late Thursday afternoon.

> Some Facebook users were just as disgusted by the rider placing the stolen shoes in his food bag, as by the act of theft.

> The footage showed the rider arriving at the customer’s flat on an e-scooter and handing over the order. GrabFood is the food delivery service of ride-sharing firm Grab.

> The rider then returned to his scooter and looked at his phone before pushing the scooter forward and putting a pair of shoes into his GrabFood delivery bag.

> While he checks the corridor for signs of onlookers before stealing the shoes, he missed the CCTV right above him.

> Ms Lim wrote that the incident happened at her cousin’s flat. 

> According to the timestamp of the footage, the incident unfolded on June 20 at about 1.41pm.

> Apart from the act of theft, some Facebook users were appalled at the use of the food delivery bag as the place the rider placed the shoes.

> User Keong Zai wrote in the comments section: “You guys just notice the shoes being stolen but disregard the hygiene of the food bag.”

> Another user, Shaun Lim, wrote: “So now I know what is the big green bag (is) for.”

> In response to TODAY’s queries, a Grab spokesperson said the firm was aware of the incident and they are still investigating the matter.

> “Grab does not condone such behavior and will terminate delivery-partners who are found guilty,” added the spokesperson.

> He is then seen walking back to the lift landing of the floor before disappearing off-camera.

> When contacted earlier, a Grab spokesperson had said, “Grab does not condone such behaviour and will ban delivery-partners who are found guilty.”

> The incident came less than a week after a 27-year-old GrabFood deliveryman was arrested for allegedly stealing a pair of shoes from outside a customer’s home.

"> # S’porean, 26, with cerebral palsy, gains confidence & earns money doing GrabFood delivery

> In the spotlight recently was a GrabFood delivery personnel in Singapore who goes around Tampines estate, and as far as Bedok, fulfilling orders in a wheelchair.

> Advertisement

> Her indefatigable spirit and revelation by Malay media Berita Harian that she has cerebral palsy touched many Singaporeans.

> GrabFood delivery a means of employment for those with disabilities

> Following up on this account, CNA Insider featured another GrabFood delivery personnel, Roszana Ali, 26, who also has cerebral palsy.

> The video took a close look at her struggles with doing this gig — as well as the pride and independence it brings to her as it is her first paying job.

> Advertisement

> GrabFood a viable employment option

> Roszana finished school seven years earlier, but had been unable to land a job despite going for six job interviews.

> The major plus point with her current GrabFood job was that she did not even have to declare that she was in a wheelchair, or that she had cerebral palsy, a condition that affects muscle control and co-ordination.

> Eight months into the job, Roszana has made more than 600 deliveries.

> Challenges in life

> Roszana is still facing challenges on the job these days, despite having had a vital door open for her to participate in Singapore’s burgeoning gig economy.

> Urban Singapore poses many physical obstacles, such as lifts that don’t work, as well as lifts that stop in between floors with units accessible only by the stairs.

> But she has met with understanding customers who do not mind walking to her location to pick up the food.

> She recounted: “I said alamak… Luckily, I had a good customer (who came upstairs) to take the food.”

> Advertisement

> She has been treated with kindness too.

> An elderly woman who was cooking bubur cha cha gave her some and another passer-by handed her S$60.

> Shy initially at work

> Roszana revealed that she was initially shy on the job as she felt she did not know the roads in Singapore well, as she did not go out often, and had trouble facing customers.

> She was introduced to GrabFood by her best friend and school mate who also has cerebral palsy.

> And there has been a few milestones.

> The first time Roszana delivered food, she was egged on by her best friend who waited for her downstairs.

> Subsequently, having broken the ice, Roszana was excited to get her GrabFood uniform — an achievement unlocked after making 100 deliveries.

> She now works Tuesdays to Sundays, five hours a day, delivering food mostly from Jurong Point shopping centre.

> She typically makes between S$5 and S$7 per order, and is able to make five to seven deliveries a day before her electric wheelchair runs out of power.

> Advertisement

> A distance of 3km to 4km is considered far and she has to reject nine out of 10 orders because of accessibility issues.

> A regular GrabFood rider can earn three times more in the same amount of time Roszana works.

> Grab has since said it will make wheelchairs a legitimate choice to be selected in the app for riders who use one.

> Grab also plans to not give deliveries beyond 3km to 4 km to wheelchair personnel, and exclude areas that are not wheelchair-friendly, so that this group will not have to waste time rejecting orders.

> Better life in the future?

> Roszana’s father still feels worried about his daughter doing the GrabFood job despite her having the experience, and gaining self-confidence and contentment.

> He wants her to have the kinds of benefits and stability that usually come with full-time employment

> “If we have money from (withdrawing our) CPF savings, I’d like to open an eatery for her. Let her manage it,” he said.

> But Roszana is in a better place than she previously was.

> She has acquired many functional skills, despite only attending school when she was 15.

> Advertisement

> Mainstream schools she applied to back then did not accept her because of he condition.

> She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at age two and had seizures.

> But her seizures stopped when she was aged 12, and three years later, her father found a place for her in the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore School in Pasir Ris.

> They took care of her transportation too.

> Before this, she picked up English by listening to her brothers speak and watching Channel 5 — with Malay subtitles for assistance.

> People with disabilities in Singapore

> There are 176,000 people with disabilities aged 20 to 64, as of 2017, as reported by The Straits Times based on the authorities’ estimates of the prevalence of disability here.

> An estimated 5 percent of people here with disabilities have jobs, which is one of the lowest rates among developed nations, ST also reported.

"> # Heated argument over GrabFood deliveryman’s e-scooter goes viral

> An angry confrontation between a pedestrian and a GrabFood driver over the latter’s electric scooter near Bishan park has gone viral after a video was posted on Facebook on Saturday.

> Mohammed Shamirrudan had been riding his scooter on the pavement when a man known as Tan apparently tried to stop him for speeding.

> After telling Tan to contact the police if he had an issue with the e-scooter, the grocery bag-wielding Tan decides he’d rather angrily confront the man. When a woman who appears to be Tan’s wife attempts to calm him down, she ends up getting knocked to the ground, where she spends significant time rolling around in pain.

> Shamirrudan also claims in his narration that Tan tried to strike him with the plastic bag of doom, though we can’t see any bag swinging in this version of the video.

> A man in dark sunglasses then shows up to mediate, suggesting that both of them calm the hell down and resolve the issue by calling the police.

> Aside from accusing Shamirrudan of speeding, Tan also said he believed Shamirrudan had violated the law by riding his scooter on the pavement in the first place.

> Not so fast, argued Shamirrudan, who said as the bike was an electric scooter and therefore a personal mobility device (PMD), he was perfectly within his rights to ride on the pavement. Based on our reading of the law (you can check it out right here), that sounds likely to be true.

> Don’t believe us? Just ask the unnamed man in sunglasses, who explained to Tan in the video that as much as he disagreed with Shamirrudan’s use of the e-scooter, the delivery man was not violating any laws.

> “The government allowed it,” he said. “He’s here for business. I don’t like this thing (PMDs), but these (are the) rules. They follow the rules. He follows the rules.”

> Believe it or not, if you stick with the video long enough, even more people show up to take sides in this ridiculousness.

> Blessedly, the police finally arrive, thus concluding our long national nightmare.

> Coconuts Singapore has contacted the police and Grab for comment and will update this story as information becomes available.

">	Honestbee salary - You receive a basic hourly salary of about $6 as well as a commission of about $8 per delivery. Apparently, you could even earn up to $18 per hour as a biker.

Doing a very simple calculation = $18 x 8 hours of work a day x 30 days in a month (If U are desperate for $ or super hardworking) = $4320

They also gave me perks to work towards, like $abc bonus if I completed xyz  no of trips in a week.

Working with foodpanda support is also a nightmare as their replies are slow and are biased towards the customer.

"Grab support, or indeed most support from corporations, are all outsourced, likely to India or the Philippines. The Level 1 support people are trained to respond based on scripts. They have no clue what Seletar Island is, and why one can’t get there on a bike. Their relevant script probably tells them to check for distance, and won’t include any exceptions to islands or floating cities for that matter.

Yes, that makes them more or less robots (with gaps in their program), but that’s entirely intended to provide some sort of consistency and quality. If you get escalated to Level 2 or 3 support, that’s where one can hope to update the “code”.",2020-07-27 21:04:37

Sometimes you as customer pay $3, sometimes you pay $4 for the common McDonalds delivery. The additional payout from GrabFood to the delivery rider also differs. I could get paid a few cents more in total delivering to somewhere closer than somewhere further because there is also the timing and the availability of riders factor. 
BUT on the whole, per job payouts have dropped between 10-20% since covid struck.

"> Food is super expensive

There are budget meals to be had if you look hard enough but you can make meals to suit your budget.

> kitchens are a pain to clean

You get better the more you practice, i promise. You even learn how to minimize the amount of cleaning you have to do as you cook. It takes experience but you'll get there, the tedium ensures it.

> I really didn't learn any recipes from my mother

Nor did i and i frankly didn't care to, we have different tastes. You can find plenty of sources on youtube or even reddit.

I only started cooking because of CB and quite frankly won't eat out unless i have to. Fried rice is an easy dish that is hard to get wrong (unless you fuck up the rice) and harder to perfect.

"I was pretty broke when I moved out, but had very flexible hours, which is a pretty good situation to learn how to economise in the kitchen. Some random thoughts:

1. Baking. A simple home made loaf, sliced and frozen, makes for a week of toast that's better tasting and cheaper than store bought presliced (unless it's one of those super budget brands, maybe). Even did a bit of math to figure out the energy costs and it was still a great deal. Time actively doing stuff in the kitchen can be very modest with some practice. Quick soda breads are stupidly easy and there's a bunch of no-knead approaches to save even more time.

2. Clean as you go. This has a bit of a learning curve, but you will save a lot of time, squeezing in cleaning into those moments where you're just looking at the pan with nothing to do. By the time my food's on the plate I'll generally only have one pan/pot and a utensil to clean. Sometimes nothing. Once cooked with a friend who'd worked in a professional setting and their economy of movement and spatial awareness were really something to behold.  If you're searing meats or otherwise ending up with crunchy brown stuff in the pan, turn that into sauce - easier cleanup, more flavour.

3. Frozen, dried, canned foods and root vegetables are your friends. Dried beans over canned, just soak them before bed. For the extremely budget conscious, cooking a giant thing of bean-based sort-of-curry (onions, garlic, carrots, celery, beans, bulk spices from an Indian grocer) and freezing it into batches to last you all week is almost unbeatable. It gets monotonous, but if I remember correctly, my meal costs were comfortably under a dollar. This is real scrimping survival stuff, with even a modest budget you can add variety. A stick blender is very useful here. Another budget friendly dish that doesn't need refrigerated ingredients is pasta puttanesca (subbing out the anchovies for canned sardines for budget and protein, or look for anchovy paste)

4. One exception to this is fresh whole chicken (never used frozen but iirc those are packed by companies catering to westerners and lack guts, feet, neck etc). Break it down, bones, neck and guts for stock, legs go into whatever soups and currys you've got going, breasts to stir fry, or maybe sear whole with veg and carbs on the side. Render the skin for schmalz (I rarely buy cooking oil, just cook stuff that renders out, saved in a jar in the fridge) and also crispy treats. Freeze the wings, every few weeks you can have a wing night or something.",2021-02-10 23:14:17

I work long hours too, till ~7:30pm most days. What I do is I try to plan out simple meals on weekdays, such as one stir fry, one easy soup (miso or egg drop or something), plus rice. Sometimes I also make a big pot of beef stew or bak kut teh on Sunday that can last me a few days so as to minimise weekday cooking.",2021-02-10 21:46:20
"Food is cheap especially for a developed country if you eat from hawker centres/coffee shops in sg. That said, still much cheaper to buy groceries and cook yourself. 

I didn’t learn recipes from my mom before moving out, but I am lucky I can still call her to ask about stuff. Also google for recipes. Just a matter of whether you have the time on the weekend to experiment with some recipes so that you can figure out the minute details (like how to chop an onion properly & *safely* because you’d be a tired hungry kanchiong spider on weekdays), and you’d eventually be good enough to slot it into the weekdays. r/EatCheapAndHealthy has a lot of nice quick & easy suggestions although it’s very pivoted towards the US ofc. There are websites out there where you can input what ingredients you have in your fridge and it links a bunch of possible recipes. Just to give you an idea of where to start. Also, if you’re gonna eat out, the best thing you can do while waiting is also *watching the chef cook* (unless you’re getting caipng w the food already done lol). You’ll thank yourself for finally learning to cook, it’s like unlocking the secrets to a part of your life. 

I get your gripe about cleaning, it’s easily the worst thing to deal with about cooking (the *oil*). But you’d learn over time how to minimise it from experience - and given you said young couples, one can cook while the other washes in the meantime so that there isn’t as much to clean up afterwards. New appliances like air fryers nowadays also minimise the pain - sure those pans are a pain to wash but they’re way less annoying than wiping off the oil on the stove and walls. 

A lot of these complaints you’re having is growing pains. But you’re with someone. Cook together, wash up together, learn together - don’t siam and let your partner tank. It’s less painful that way, and is a good way to bond. And now you can control your exact tastes instead of whatever your parents insist you eat!",2021-02-10 18:31:01
"Speaking as someone who moved into a new place with my SO during the beginnings of the WFH phenomenon, most of the meals I/we have are home prepped. We only refrain from cooking (i.e. order food delivery, eat leftovers) when one of us is not at home for that meal.

Over the last few months, I've gotten used to fine tuning the things I cook (I'm the chef) such that they don't require so much attention or are easy to clean. For instance, curries/stews/braises are great because they basically cook themselves for the most part. I try to get my meats boneless as well so I don't make a mess trying to debone the damn thing and wasting meat, and also for the convenience. If you're not particular, frozen chicken/pork is really convenient since you can get like 2-3 kilos at a time.

We try not to deep fry too much since cleaning both the pot/wok and stove area is a pain, but shallow fries are okay. Something I do quite often is tonkatsu which chicken breasts or pork loins. Cooking steak is also a good idea for the odd treat, and if you're a fan of the reverse sear method like I am, you can take most of the guesswork out of getting cooking times right.",2021-02-10 21:13:35

"I know cleaning can be a pain in the ass; here are some tips that worked wonders for me:
1. I have found it is always easier to clean out oily pans and crockery by first cleaning away all of the oil with tissue/kitchen towel. Saves a lot of time, soap and water to ensure they aren't still oily by the time they are dried. 
2. Sometimes more effective to use fingers than sponge to clean out corners remove stuck pieces of food 
3. Soak rice cooker pot with water while you rinse and wash the rest of the utensils; by the time you get to cleaning the rice from the pot, the ride should be able to be removed more quickly
4. More efficient to rinse and soap everything then wash them in a batch, then to do so one item at a time (see 6)
5. Always ensure that your dish drainers are empty and ready to receive clean plates whenever you do a cooking session.
6. If you only have one sink like I do, I'll rinse all the plates/pots over the sink, then soap them up and stack them on the countertop. I leave the utensils last (or you can clear them first). Now I'm free to just wash and remove the detergent off them and put them for draining.",2021-02-10 22:08:27

"We’ve both lived overseas alone so cooking is just a habit for us. 

If you’re lazy to cook, get a slow cooker. You can throw things into it in the morning and come home to a nice warm meal. For rice, you can get those Japanese rice cookers and cook a big batch in the morning that you just leave on warm the whole day. There are also plenty of one-pot meals you can make, or you can meal prep on weekends and microwave them over the week. There are a lot of options. Overall it’s way cheaper and healthier than eating out all the time. 

Cleaning isn’t a huge pain if you’re careful and don’t fry things a lot. I just do a simple wipe down after every meal and wash dishes while waiting for things to cook. Stainless steel and nonstick pans are a MUST because I hate cleaning those. Also get a rice cooker that has a pot with texture (not smooth base) - the rice doesn’t seem to stick on those as much.",2021-02-10 19:18:11

Recipes can be found online, or ask your mom; my mom will always complain and ask me why I want to learn but she'll then proceed to make that dish the following week and force me to learn step by step.

I think that as long as you set your expectations and don't expect to have a gourmet experience, you'll be good to go. If you see cooking as a chore, then you probably won't really enjoy the process, try to enjoy it first.",2021-02-10 20:56:10

"hmm let's see...

> Food is super expensive

Depends on how you look at it. In terms of pure cost, it's almost always cheaper to cook yourself. The problem is economies of scale/effort. The ingredients in the $3.50 2 veg 1 meat cai png may cost only $1.50, but you can't go to the market and buy 20g of veggies to cook one serving. Plus all the time it takes you to stir fry one portion of vegatables... sometimes it really is not worth the time and effort to cook. 

But there are certain dishes which are easier to cook at home, and much cheaper. A lot of meals we make at home are with less ingedients, but more premium ones. Things like baked salmon, or even the occasional steak. Relatively easy to cook, and you definitely save so much compared to eating outside. A prime grade steak costs maybe $30 from the butcher, and you'd have to pay $90 for it outside.

So nowadays, we eat cheap cai png outside, and treat ourselves to good food at home.

> kitchens are a pain to clean

Amen to that. Again, we cook stuff that doesn't require as much cleanup. An oven is your friend (if you don't have one, can get a portable toaster/oven). Hood helps a lot. Look up one-pot recipes. 


> and I really didn't learn any recipes from my mother.

My mum tried to teach me recipes, but ironically all her recipes turned me off cooking.

Not to diss my parents or anything, but the older generation has a different style of cooking - lots of stir fry, marinating, high heat cooking with wok, lots of prep with chopping garlic and spring onion and all that. That kind of food is made ofr large families - easy to cook 10 portions of, but it takes way too much effort to cook 1 portion. Not to mention after work I have absolutely no patience to cut, marinate, chop and do all that shit. If I wanted that kind of food, I'd rather pay for my 2 veg 1 meat cai png. 

We started cooking more after looking up different recipes. Simple western pastas, baked rice etc. Western food tends to come in individual portions, and is more suitable for a couple.

Good luck!",2021-02-11 17:22:38

"Hi, I'm 40 years old and a female. My dad was a taxi driver and previously was a hawker. Our dynamics were/are similar to yours. 

I used to think that my family dynamics were normal (when I was little, I thought everyone had the same structure, routine), then abnormal (from my teens to adult years,  I thought my family was severely broken), and now that I'm older, I find my  broken family to be a typical case. 

Having worked in standard office jobs then did a brief stint as a childcare teacher, it hit me why my dad was so inert. Manual jobs are physically, mentally and emotionally tiring. At the end of an office work day, I still have the headspace to watch movie, surf the net and cook.  But after a day as a childcare teacher, I have been so overwhelmed by demands from others, having to stay alert all the time, that I often come home to stay in the dark for 2hrs. I see that in my partner too, who is working in aged care.  He simply has no energy to do any sport or engage in a hobby. 

I also felt that my dad, by not engaging in hobbies, could save money that could go to us. And by and by, up to now after, where he's retired and doesn't have to care for the children, he's gotten so used to a life without learning, hobbies. 

There were only me, my sibling and my mum that he had to care for. Ie 4 people. No grandparents.

I hated my parents for a very long time, into my 30s. I felt that all they could care about was money. 

Then I realised, it was their biggest fear for a good reason. We were working class and had no safety net at all.

Now that I'm fending for myself, I realise how stressful it is and how that changes me into a fear-based, anxious person. Especially in an insecure job. There is such a world of difference between manual, casual jobs and office work. With the latter, you can take leave any day and get paid as well. With the former, you have to work non-stop. In my contract and "" manual"" jobs, I was stressed out and very unhappy. 

It's only in recent years that I realised how tiring it had been for my parents, and how demoralising it just have been, knowing: I'm working so hard and I can't afford to give the very best to my children, that I don't have time for them. I'm doing so poorly compared to the rest of my family members, to the rest of society. 

I also thought,  ""well, it's ok to be poor but they can have a better attitude."" Yes, that's true to a degree too. But I've experienced being in a rut and being utterly depressed, so I can't say I would fare better than them if I have 3 mouths to feed. 

Also, on being able to talk and communicate, my peers and I are considered gen X (i think) and 90% of their husbands can't communicate or want to spend time with their children. 50% are going through estrangement or divorce. If that is possible among my generation, I think older generations would find it even harder to operate in another manner. Of course, age is not a clear determinant of parenting attitudes, there are always people who do not fall into that pattern of behaviour.

I'm so sorry to say this but if not all members of your family are on board with this idea, it's just not going to happen.

If your father can't give you the affection you need, please look for it somewhere else. Pinning for your father's affection when he has none to give will only lead to you being disappointed and unfulfilled. 

Besides, there's always two sides of the same coin - you don't have a close knit family and that means you have one less factor tying you down if you want or need to go somewhere far away.

Sec 4 - dropped tampons into a gay teacher's bag. Yes, we were assholes

Sec ??? - played AOE2 in the school's computer lab. We managed to somehow convince the teacher in charge that AOE2 was an educational game. The school bought a few copies for the technology club and we had awesome lan parties in there. This was the early 2000s and Lan shops were all the rage, so to have a free one in school was awesome

"We used to have to run up 7 flights of stairs to get back to class after recess since only teachers were allowed to use the lift. But were always late, so when we saw our teacher for the next period getting into the lift at the first floor, we would sprint up the stairs while pressing the lift at every floor so they wouldn't beat us to class and consider us ""late"", even though they already expected us to be late all the time anyway. 

Another time we had the brilliant idea to hide one classmate in the shelf right beside the teacher's table. The idea was that he would question my classmate's absence and he would pop out just on time, but there was just never a right comedic timing for it so he stayed in staking it out. Eventually the teacher just bought our excuse that he was sick in the toilet and the class went on, so he waited and waited and waited, and in the end just... awkwardly emerged halfway through the period next to where the teacher was sitting, said hi, squeezed past and went back to his seat. It was hilariously awkward and our teacher just stood there puzzled as we all laughed away and tried to explain our dumb logic to him.",2021-01-24 16:16:35

Making a food delivery service from canteen to class. And earning service fee from it. (We are a two-person team) we were quite entrepreneurial back then haha!

Omg my favourite was having us make videos for class projects! Those saved me from failing my subjects because my English was poor and couldn’t understand shit in class. Learning how to spell mitochondria took me weeks. Technical skills saved me from failing CAs :D

"We had kind classmates who are generous enough to order pizzas for the whole class once in a while (more often than not, they don't ask us to chip in). The pizzas bonded us even if some of us weren't as close to each other.

P.s: During CCA camps, I definitely liked sleeping in our classrooms. The sound of the ceiling fans everytime we sleep in the classrooms, is still vivid in my memory.

Not forgetting the teachers who are actually hilarious at times. 

I also remember running towards the canteen once our P.E lesson ends. Also the Malay stall makcik so kind, I was struggling with my wallet and she thought I didn't have enough money, so she said it's okay you can pay on another day. The Western stall ah ma always greets us students with a sweet smile.

P.s: how can I forget detention lol I remember whenever we're late, they made us walk in a straight line at the field to pick up trash and there were so many cigarette butts 🙄 detention was peaceful and time for me to just do my homework. Also at first, when I entered school I thought it's embarrassing that the school flashes the detention namelist and hours every morning but as time went by, I was amused and expected my name to show up in front of the whole school

Also idk if other classes do this but people from my class plugged their phones in the hdmi(?) or speaker cable in class that cher always use. So during recess, the class sometimes blast out music through the classroom speaker while the doors and windows are closed due to aircon. Also, I didn't use phone in class so I have nothing to worry about but it's hilarious seeing my classmates fumbling to hide their phones while the discipline master peek from outside 😂",2021-01-24 13:03:10

And probably the one of the most memorable thing we did: dry ice bomb. So during one of those carnival events, I managed to procure some dry ice, and I itchy-finger go and put it into a plastic bottle, filled it with water, and tightened the cap. We then left it at a corner of the classroom but still nothing happened, until me and another friend moved closer using a chair as a tactical shield, that's when it blew up, splintering me and my friend with plastic shards.

For me my results were fucking bad at the end of sec 2 for streaming (due to various factors from academic stress & some social issues), so I ended up in one of the last classes. You can imagine my depression at the time. 

Yet it led into the best 2 years of my schooling life. A lot happened, but in short most of my interests and hobbies now stemmed from dabbling in them during that time. Despite getting into a better stream and so on afterwards, my heart still lies with that class, and I still chuckle when thinking back at the nonsense we got into alongside all the struggles.

"My sec school days were pretty crazy & fun.We had this Malaysian Chinese math teacher which whenever he speak english,his accents is very heavy.One of my classmates uses to make jokes about his accents.That was during Sec 2.

During our Upper Sec,i think he couldn't take the joke/maybe not,but he doesn't only teach maths,but science too.So i guess he stop teaching our class & we usually see him in the staff office/principal office.

During our days,WWE & Soccer were huge.So the bad boys will usually spar during recess.Sometimes they play soccer at the badminton/parade square.

During my secondary years,there also happen of sex scene in school(happen in 4th level toilet) located beside Computer labs which usually empty.Most of them didn't get caught,but news travel fast. A couples from my class also did it there.

Lastly,i am probably the only guy who has evaded CCA.whenever i saw the CCA HOD in my way,i would walk away.But the HOD never chase me,just talk to me why i nvr join any cca.The CCA HOD is a pretty chilled guy & by sec 3,whenever i see him,he will always say,take CCA.not too late to earn some points.",2021-01-24 19:59:55

"-I always laugh recalling this with my secondary school friends and we were jokingly saying this is probably why adults don't trust us with our ideas.
So basically for secondary 3 year end paper for Social studies, there's a SRQ about how can they government help increase birth rates in Singapore. Our marker is a really chill teacher so he went through all the weird answers we gave and look like he was questioning his life while talking about it. Apparently there were some M18 answers but we never heard them instead we got these:

1) Lower the price of love hotels, so more people can do the devil's tango and have kids.

2) Get rid of the sexuality education classes. (I'm sure if he said the explanation the student said but I'm assuming the logic in the mind of a kid is that this causes people to afraid of doing the devil's tango and fewer babies or something like that?)

To which my teacher being the sane and responsible adult has to correct some things. Like how
1) It's not logical since couples could do the devil's tango on the couch at home for free (his words btw)

2) sexuality education is teach teens the importance of sex safe and proper family planning. It's not something they should remove entirely just to solve the problem of lower birth rates by replacing it with possible problems of rise in teen pregnancy and STDs etc.



-Another 1 was around the last week of school in sec 4 before we had our school break to prepare for olevels. So many of our subjects teachers instead of rushing papers , decided to just talk about their personal story in life - what they like before and the lessons they want us to know as well as what they saw in us. It was really nice hearing the stuff they say, personally I felt a lot of connection from them because of personal they were willing to be with us. But there was this 1 instance that stood out because of my math teacher. 

Basically my English teacher was giving this really heartwarming about how proud she is of our growth as people. That while there are many instances we made her really mad and disappointed at us, we ultimately change for the better and she was really happy to see it. Which made her cry while telling us this. So our class got just as emotional but we also tried to comfort her, class chairman gave a tissue to wipe her tears. Everything was super emotional and we were really sentimental.

THEN OUT CAME WAS MY MATH TEACHER. He just casually opened the door, cause I think he really wanted to give us something at the moment but as u can tell it was bad timing. Made really awkward was how he looked at my English teacher and asked, ""eh, you crying ah?"". Yeah so he turned this whole emotional moment into a class joke where we joke saying he probably ask his baby daughter the same question.",2021-01-24 15:05:58

Having my best friend fight with 2 teachers as he tried to stand up for the class (he regretted the earlier fight, but did not regret the 2nd fight)

I ""won"" a Geography competition, and principal requested I do a speech on it. So I spammed the speech with jokes of the self-deprecating kind and tried my best to make it interesting and not boring and not narcissistic.

My idiot friends pasted a \[Redacted\] on the \[Redacted\] flag

Discipline Master requested I become an EXCO, despite my parents and my protests. (And by request, I meant guilt-tripped). He expected me to fill-up the form and submit it. I tore it up when he wasn't looking and didn't do it. Nothing happened afterwards lol

I rejected a girl. (oversimplified) Her whole group basically hated me and spread rumours that persisted until graduation. (I mean I was kinda an ass at the time so it wasn't totally uncalled for)

My studies did dip a bit but not so much until requires my Form Teacher to do what she did.

In the end, the amount of effort spent wasted cause kena removed from 2 CCA projects and my nomination for student leader given to another CCA friend.

"Graduated 12 years ago, and from an elite boy’s school somewhere in the central. 

Every morning, after morning assembly, you will see rows of classes in pushup positions. Our DM will go inspect the classroom for cleanliness (chairs on table, no crumpled paper balls on floor, etc) after the school day. Classes who fail the cleanliness check will stay back after morning assembly the next day lor. 

But really, that DM isn’t an asshole. He was tough but at the same time I (and many others) have great respect for him. 

Others... well we had a PE teacher that we all hated. I mean from a matured man’s POV he was probably trying his best at his job and nothing particularly harmless. But his disciplinary style and expectations were super hard-handed, and basically had enjoyed zero rapport with the students. When I was in sec4, someone (heard it was from my batch) draw crude graffiti dissing him on the school’s rock-climbing wall. That group (cant be a one-man’s job) even drew a giant penis on the parade square. I remember the teachers rushing to cover it using whatever they can.

"Graduated from secondary school in 2012 and I had the most fun during those 4 years.

My school made it compulsory for every student to purchase a MacBook in sec 1. However, there isn’t much classes that are ‘designed’ to use the MacBook, we only use it to watch physics videos on youtube. So our entire class decided to use it as our personal gaming laptop, playing games like Dota on it. Everytime when we need to ‘watch educational videos on youtube’, you will see everyone start bringing out their mouse and the only thing you hear is the clicking sound of our mouse. 

When we were sec 3, the school said no need bring MacBook liao (I think they haven’t thought of how to ‘incorporate’ MacBook into upper sec education, since we were the second batch to own a MacBook). So we changed to playing yugioh and duel master cards. Everyday during recess, our class machiam gambling den. 

In sec 4 when almost everyday got phone lagi better, we started playing games on our phone, we will purposely buy those big big pencil case so we can put our phone inside the pencil case and play without looking too obvious (thinking back, it was pretty fcking obvious so the teachers probably didn’t care). 

We only really wake up our idea to study after prelims, our whole class got ppl almost full marks for L1R5. 

Even still, 1 day before O lvl science practical, my friend and I dabao KFC to eat in class while studying and for some reason, we decided to throw our rubbish out the window, our classroom was on the 6th floor. We got caught by the DM but got let off for that day because practical is the next day. Next day after practical, he made the 2 of us clear rubbish in front of the whole school.

Buying manga from the school bookstore and reading it with friends before the start of the school day.

Buying coffee from the school canteen and playing Taiko no Tatsujin on DS with friends before morning assembly. Well, the coffee part was because I was sleep-deprived, so that wasn't so great.

"It went down like this: After several rounds one of the girls was on her last shirt button, with four cards in hand. Garang ah lian kept asking her to hit. Based on the rules of “Ban Luck” if she picked up a 5th card without going bust then she would win double, and I would literally lose my pants. However as she was on her last button she didn’t have enough collateral, and who should save the day but the garang ah lian, who suggest that if the girl went bust then she would take off her own shirt as well.

So it came down to the last card, and for us two horny teenage boys it was the most exciting thing ever",2021-01-25 18:27:51

It was honestly a very relaxed place, free to do what you want, with of course, no smoking inside, etc. Behave well, smoke, go outside, curfew guys get in by curfew.

"Don’t need to read. Tbh banks don’t value or reward customer loyalty. Also, there is no one single card that can be optimised for personal expenditure. 

My thoughts, use a card for family expense and another for personal expense. As for cash back, aim for new cards reward. Most of the banks, especially international banks gives welcome rewards for new card holders. For example, HSBC gives $180 for $800 spending. That is like a 6 months of rebates assuming a 3% return on a 1k monthly spending, assuming you can optimise your spending to achieve a 3% returns. Standard chartered or AMEX gives similar amount in cash or in kinds (Apple Watch, ear pods). This is in comparison to $30 welcome gift for existing customers. How do you qualify as a new customer, you may ask. The definition for all banks are “non card holder for 12 months”. So if you cancel your card and reapply a new card 12 months later, you are considered a new customer. 

The plan, apply for a HS (or other banks cards), make the minimum spend and take the welcome gift, hold for 6 months and cancel it thereafter. Apply for the same card 12 months after.",2021-02-14 15:32:54

Your spending patterns may shift slightly from month to month, and as a result the ""perfect"" setup for that month may also be different. The fact for most people is that a couple of good cards including one that best rewards their heaviest spending category is good enough. Min-maxing is usually not worth it to squeeze out an extra 0.2% or something for all that extra effort.

"Foodpanda is by far the worst out of the big three. My personal ranking goes like deliveroo>grab>>>>foodpanda


Deliveroo is the most reliable of the 3 in terms of driver availability and non cancellations. Pretty good with service too, got no question refunds when items missing. Only con of deliveroo is that selection is smaller than grab.


Grab has the best restaurants selection of the 3, but not being able to find a rider and rider cancellation is fairly common. Service is decent


Foodpanda is just shit at all",2020-09-05 23:55:22
"i couldnt even get a refund for the same situation. ordered $40+ worth of food, used $40 voucher bought on shopee to offset, paid remaining with card.
only half the food came cos remaining was not available, but foodpanda was only willing to refund the few dollars i paid with my credit card. i was too lazy to continue the back and forth with the customer service",2020-09-06 00:35:11
"I think they're probably done with losing money.  Also their app is riddled with ""glitches"" and false advertising.  Recently I've been facing a problem with the delivery fees shown being different from when I checked out.  And before anyone suggests that it was because I didn't refresh,  i exited the app,  deleted items from my cart and tried again.  Same thing happened.  The shops section also can show free delivery (without the over $15 minimum spend)  and when i check out,  I'm charged for delivery fees!  The fees are also getting steeper and steeper.  If it weren't for them being the cheaper option i wouldn't bother.",2020-09-06 07:40:54
"> For anyone who's dealt with foodpanda before, communication with front line reps are boring and riddled with incompetence (i.e. getting the details wrong or sending irrelevant replies), so it isn't that interesting. The manager takes the cake though! She told me that I should see it from foodpanda's perspective instead because they care so much about customer satisfaction and service recovery.

It's amazing how stingy they are, even with customer accounts that have been with them for _years_.

Then again, this is the company [whose CSOs issued me a random discount code (with minimum spend) that was _already expired_](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/g2owogd/), and required me to explain myself over and over whenever I tried to get it fixed.",2020-09-06 02:24:09

"Same issues as you but not vouchers. Order 3 mains and 3 sides. Only delivered the 3 sides and main OOS and refunded for the main. Got angry cause whats the point of delivering the sides but no mains? So i paid for delivery and all the fees so to eat sides only.  


Imagine going to kfc and ordering the set meal but getting the drink only and paying $2/3 plus for that. If i know dont have, i would have went other shops. Was the last time i used foodpanda.

Contrary to a lot of users here, I have had mostly positive experiences with Foodpanda and mostly negative ones with GrabFood when it comes to refunds (when I still used GrabFood in the past before the service fee shit kicked in). 

Deliveroo has the best customer service, but the markups are ridiculous, most expensive food out of the three. GrabFood has the best range of restaurants, but its service fee is ridiculous and I refuse to use it since. Foodpanda is the only one I use, given its reasonable prices and delivery fee. The only bad thing is its limited range of restaurants compared to the other two.",2020-09-06 10:48:44

"Had the same situation as well, I had ordered a total of $50+ worth of food, and the wrong set of food came and it was $5 more expensive in total compared to the original set of food which I've ordered.

Used a $30 voucher and paid the remaining with the card, and they refunded only the remaining that was paid to them. I got lucky cause I had received extra food and they were willing to refund me, so I didn't pursue the matter further after the refund.",2020-09-06 16:09:58
"> I’m guessing the “manager” didn’t want to escalate any further over a “trivial” matter.

I've dealt with Foodpanda customer service myself. It's impossible to escalate to anyone incompetent, short of replying to every comment on their social media.

"The tldr will be:

1. Bought voucher expiring in Dec 2020
2. Used voucher and had missing item in order.
3. Foodpanda provided a refund with voucher that expires in August 2020 and told me to suck it up when it expired.

However, they initially shortchanged me and refused to provide the voucher in between 2 and 3 :).",2020-09-05 21:19:03

"For clarity, it wasn't raised at the point when they issued the voucher because I've been ""talking"" to them for 4 days regarding balance owed. It was raised again when the voucher expired.

Besides, given the state of their customer service, what were the chances that they'd engage in extending the voucher since it was already issued.

"Hello fellow rider,

My only advice to you is to work hard and smart at the same time!

If you can afford to cancel on a ""lousy"" job, go ahead. If you just want jobs, auto-accept all jobs and ride like Lance on steroids. By lousy, I mean riding to a restaurant 2.5km away and delivering another 2.5km further away to a secluded coldspot. All that for maybe $5.20? Not worth my while. You'll tire out in no time. Because the next thing you know after you cancel on that lousy job, you might get an easy job collecting from a spot a min ride away and delivering a street away for $4.50. Yes, some people just have that luxury to order food delivery from a mall beside them.

The allocation algorithm is pretty random but if you've done your area long enough, you'll know the invisible boundaries (even so, that is always changing). If you're that lone hero rider on a rainy day, you'll be pretty much swarmed.

An order number with an ""F"" suffix behind is an order placed in advance with the restaurant so usually, I'd expect the food to be churned out fast. Otherwise, there is no hurry to jump red lights (which I sometimes do. \*guilty\*) to rush to a restaurant because ultimately, you'll still wait for the food. Some will smoke and lepak outside before going to collect the food. I just check that the full address was provided and plan the route and familiarise the location while waiting. The only time you should rush is to the customer's location, deliver and get your next job ping.

Walking around as in casually strolling around the red zones?,2020-08-19 01:20:46
"Sure. Would just like to share some things not often shared when talking about grabfood runs.

I think its a good idea to invest in a decent bicycle and learn how to do basic maintenance yoursel if you intend to do it for a reasonable amount of time.  I sometimes see guys riding on sub 100dollars bike with rusty chain and squeeky brakes. Not only is it less pleasurable and efficient to ride, it is definitely more dangerous as well. Just something solid, but not too flashy will do. You dont want junk, but you dont want a thief bait as either. I personally am not a fan of ebikes, so Ive spent some money on a decent fixed gear bike and it paid for itself with a week's pay. Try to invest in decent gear as well. Like a pair of shades, waterproof shoes, bike lights, powerbank, raincoat etc. they'll pay for themselves eventually. Least you should learn to do is to change tyres, and clean and lube your chain. If its raining, deflate your tyres by about 10psi. It would make it roll slightly worse, but would make it have slightly more traction in the wet.

If you are comfortable riding on the road, then definitely do that. Itd make your rides more efficient.  Definitely learn the traffic rules first before doing that though. If you are strictly riding only pavements then mountain bikes might be more suitable, but something with slick tyres would be better for road riding imo. I ever seen guys riding fatbikes that look like they weigh 30kg and with a low gear ratio.... I honestly have no idea how they do more than 10 runs a day. In anycase, play around with saddle height and make it perfect. Too low, you might hurt your knee. Too high, you might hurt your back.

Try to manage your pedaling cadence and keep it consistent. A good way to tire yourself out early is to do a sprint and abruptly stop at the red light. Try to time the lights so that you have momentum to flow through them. Also, If the merchant is slow(pretty often), I would just text my customer to keep them updated so they wouldnt assume that I am the one taking my own sweet time. And so far, all of them had been very understanding.

Think of ways to secure your food, especially drinks and soup items to make sure they dont spill. General rule of time is to shove items together so there is not a lot of play between them when the box is shifting. Everyone's got their own style, Ill leave that up to you to decide.

Its good to plan your schedule. Im more free recently so I have been aiming for  90trip in 5 weekdays incentive.  Definitely try to hit the incentives if possible for more bang for your buck. Managing to do it on a single speed bicycle thus far. I try to spread the workload over 5 days(18trips per day avg) to give my body and mind more time to recover. Yeah, sometimes the mind gets tired before the body does. Sometimes if the dispatch flow is good, Id do more runs and exceed my target for the day. But sometimes if they send me back to near my house which is low on grab merchant, Ill just call it a day before I hit my target to keep my cancellation rate low.

To hit the incentives. try to keep your cancellation rate low. If you there are plenty of riders though, just accept the shit job I guess else you might have to wait a long time for the next order. If its peak hour, its generally a good idea to cancel the shit jobs. Play around with the auto accept function to manage your cancellation/acceptance rate. If your auto accept is off, orders you reject only goes into your acceptance rate. So if you do the math, you can actually reject 2 orders out of 10. I personally feel like the system can be greatly improved to serve both the Grab and the riders better. But as of now it is a cat and mouse game. So, just play the game well for now I guess.

&#x200B;

Take your time to get to the restaurant, as retarded as it sounds. Because sometimes grab reward you for being slow by giving you stacked orders(yes, its true). Click 'I am at the restaurant' ASAP when you arrive, but dont click 'COLLECT ORDER' yet. If the restaurant takes 30mins or longer to prepare, then request a chat on the app and ask for cash reimbursement. Grab will NOT reimbursement you if you did not take the initiative to REQUEST for the cash. Thats a sneaky sneaky move on their part tbh, and alot of new riders are NOT aware of this feature. So please, spread the word. You may pick up the pace once you are delivering the food to customer's place.

I do try to be fast if the merchant has a reputation for being efficient though. Once youve done enough runs in your area, you'll know who are the slow ones. I would rush to the merchants asap during my first week, only to wait for more than 30mins(not reimbursed lol). If you get a slow merchant, just use the time to use the washroom and grab a bite and do some window shopping I guess. You might get additional orders or 2.

Its definitely a good idea to be friendly to your customers, by greeting them instead of showing them a blackface. Might net you an extra TIP or 2. Not sayin you should be doing it for the money though lol. Its for sure a good feeling when your warmness is reciprocated.  And if you do enough grab rides, you'll be surprised who are the most generous tippers(hint\* not the ladies and gentlemen staying in highend apartments).

I guess its time we adapt or we get weeded out by those who are more adaptable. I am just grateful that me and my family are in good health and we still have a roof over our head. And without the covid situation, I would never have tried grab delivery. It was a good opportunity to visit parts of Singapore that I never would have been to.

It's the same for most uniforms. Even those you see retail staff wear are not allowed to be re-used by them outside work and they are required to return it when they resign. The company then rips them apart or something like that. It's for branding and security.",2021-01-03 13:56:11

> A 49-year-old British expatriate originally from Wales has signed up as a GrabFood delivery rider in Singapore.

> He wasn't retrenched or anything, as he is doing it for a good cause.

> Anthony Houlahan, vice-president of strategy for telecommunications company Ericsson Telecommunications, is still keeping his day job but he is hustling on the side to raise money for the Children's Cancer Foundation (CCF).

> The goal is to raise S$100,000 by the end of the circuit breaker period -- which has ended, but Houlahan is riding on.

> The Singapore permanent resident, who has been living here for 18 years, said it is his way of harnessing his own restlessness, energy, and get some workout outdoors, while contributing back to society and Singapore, which he admits has been nice to him.

> Started on April 22

> Houlahan told The Straits Times previously: ""It was a completely spur-of-the-moment decision. I picked the CCF because I wanted to help children in need. They have done nothing to deserve their illness and have their whole lives ahead of them.""

> He then started his deliveries on April 22, after hearing the circuit breaker extension announcement on April 21.

> He raised S$4,500 in five days.

> Houlahan rides his bicycle to do deliveries in the evenings and weekends.

> He lives alone here as his wife and two daughters, aged 21 and 23, are in the United Kingdom.

> In two weeks, he raised more than S$15,000.

> On Day 44, on June 4, he updated that he has raised S$56,000.

> The money he raised so far came from delivery fees, as well as tips and donations pledged to the Giving.sg website, where S$44,171 has been raised from 293 donors.

> Donors can pledge to donate between five cents and S$1 for every dollar Houlahan earns.

> He reports the amount daily on his website and provides breakdowns.

> Going the distance

> He does about eight deliveries on weekdays.

> On weekends, he clocks more miles and does even more deliveries.

> He can start at 10.30am and finish at about 6.30pm.

> On one Saturday, he made 21 deliveries after cycling 77km.

> Working about 20 to 25 hours a week, Houlahan estimates a typical rider can earn about S$400, ST reported.

> Houlahan also told the BBC: ""It can be hot, it can be sunny, it can be wet. It's a tough job. A lot of people do that to feed themselves and their families.""

> ""So I have utmost respect for those guys.""

Any Grab Food Delivery who read that sign would think it refers to them! 

I hope their new sign should be better worded as, ""Grab Food Delivery Partners here to collect food from the Food Stalls in the Basement, please use the stairs only. If you are here to deliver food to residents upstairs, please proceed to use the lift.""

Edit: Just saw your edit after I made my comment. So what you are saying is that they should update the sign so that it would be understood by people when it's posted out of context on the internet?

First time I'm hearing of grabfood hub though, so not sure how it works exactly, other than that it consolidates hawker food for onward distribution. If the hub is at B1 as they say, then indeed the notice is pretty badly-worded as it should be specific to the hub delivery partners.

>Grab revealed that the notice was actually put up in Mar. 2019. According to Grab, it was at the request of the condominium's management committee. 

As for that comment accusing some new delivery guy to be a shit-stirrer. The sign is clearly badly worded to mean, ALL Grab Delivery Partners, and literally doesn't mention anything about forbidden to use lifts for Collections Only.

Any new guy unless already regular would not be able to even understand the Poster meaning correctly. According to the English Language in the Poster, it clearly says, ALL Grab Delivery Partners are to refrain from using the Lift, that it is for Residents only.

Probably what happened was that the management said something like ""could you please tell your drivers...."" and Grab responded by putting up the sign and so both parties can make their statements without being wrong.

You're reading it as a standalone sign without context. Definitely it's a poorly worded sign, there's no denying it. The point is that people weren't getting confused by it because of the context it was in. The condo management's statement also mentions that the staircases to the residences were locked. Nobody was mistakenly climbing stairs because they didn't even have access to it.",2020-05-28 21:14:38

"But can you imagine the inconvenience of a delivery person? After reading that sign and then realise no access to stair case, will have to go hunt for security to give access to staircase to climb up? If they were earnest about following the rules. It would be wasting so much of their time. 
A normal rule following person if see staircase lock, will not proceed to use the lift, with such a strong message that says, ""Lift are for Residents only!"" in fear they might get complain.
And then don't even know if condo security is informed of actual rules since this whole mess seem to be one big miscommunication, once delivery person point to the sign, the condo security might just let them use the stairs.",2020-05-28 21:20:18

"This reminded me of my late aunty who used to run a stall in a primary school. She saved up some money and decided to run a stall with a friend. She told me how she had to buy over secondhand equipment, bowls and cutlery. She even had to go through a tasting at the school. She told me that she had to put a couple stalks of bokchoy in the soup so it looks “healthy” and have whole prawns and fishballs.

My aunt used prawn heads and shell to boil soup for prawn noodles and makes tom yum soup from scratch. I wasn’t sure how much that would cost, but I’m guessing the costs add up because she told me she eventually had to half the prawns and fishballs. She also only put 1 stalk of bok choy because end of the day, the vegetables get tossed by the children. While she loved serving children, she eventually closed down her business. I’m guessing it wasn’t profitable and was too much work. She then went on to work as a drink stall helper at a secondary school, which also closed down.

I’m not sure how much food in primary school cost now. 15 years ago when I was in primary school, all I had was white rice with 1 fried egg and soy sauce on top for 50 cents. Now that I’m in Uni, I pack my own lunch to save money. However, on days where I didn’t pack my own food, I’m lucky enough to have $2.50/$3 cai png. My friends and I always wonder how the uncle makes money selling food this cheap, but we are also super grateful, otherwise other stalls have food easily 2-3 times the price.",2020-09-05 08:43:57

"Remember who your target audience is... students. Do you think students are willing to pay heaps of money on the same food for their span in their school for 4 ~ 6 years? I personally won't. There are far many options outside of school that can get my moneys worth of food but why would i choose school food? If you are to price the food high nobody is going to buy. But if you were to price it reasonable then students would find it reasonable to buy it. 

And you can't compare to hawkers as hawkers rental ain't cheap some can cost even upwards of 4k SGD. This doesn't even include manpower and utility bills and etc. So 1.5k sgd is extremely reasonable for a canteen store already. Furthermore there are way lesser options in a canteen store. Imagine you are in a hawker center with hundreds of stores but your food is kind of average. Not many people would buy it. So if you were to open a hawker then your are literally doomed to fail unless your food is above average. But in a canteen atleast people would buy it as there isnt much choices.",2020-09-04 15:56:10

"I had no idea that rental is $10 monthly.

Some quick calculations:

A primary school typically has +500 students enrolled for P1, P1-P6 cohort, and assuming that there are 6 other stalls, you are looking at around 500 customers daily for each stall.

If you sell 500 plates a day at $3, and you want a profit of $4500 (excluding manpower), the maximum cost price you can afford is $2.50.

Looking at the cost of these ingredients, it is about $1.5 total, let's round this to $2 to account for expendables like oil and salt etc. You are looking at a gross revenue of $9,500 monthly. To break even, you just need to sell 25 plates a day, or 75 plates if you want to pay yourself $1,000",2020-09-04 15:29:09
"Wow this person sounds entitled af.

Compare apples to apples: You're in a school canteen. Not a hawker centre. Hawker rental differs. Hawkers also pay the additional waste disposal and utilities that you're quoting. $500.70 is cheap. Price your goods accordingly because if they wanted to food prices to be similar to hawker centre prices they would just charge you hawker rental and utilities rates.

Manpower is your prerogative. So don't add this to the mix.

If the hawkers can operate from 8am to 10pm every day, I'm sure managing inventory for 7 hours less is wayyyyy more manageable both in terms of storage and transport.

Similarly for school canteen. While the business hours are shorter than hawker stalls, the customer turnover during those hours are much higher than average hawker stall.

"At least with school canteens you are guaranteed a certain traffic unless you are so terrible that you can't sell at all at which point you should be questioning your own cooking rather than blaming on it being a ""limited market"".

Also depending on how you look at it, being only able to sell on school days can be a good or bad thing. I mean, ya you can consider it forced no pay leave but they could use that time either to pursue their interest or a side job (example: forex trading or being a GrabFood rider).

Open market also means more competition. You could have 3 chicken rice stalls but only the best sells to make a profit, the other to break even and the worst to not sell any substantial amount at all. With school canteens you could sell shitty food but still have customers simply because students have a time restraint (no time to queue) or food variety. Also realistically it isn't 24/7 and in fact most stalls I believe aren't even open for all 3 meals of the day. They'd be working an upwards of 12 hours if that's the case considering opening and closing time =/= working hours.

Tbh a lot of school canteen owners that move to hawker centers.
I know my sec school mix veg aunty moved to my house downstairs. I talk to her a lot, apparently she makes almost the same amount (pre-covid obv). I guess the main difference will be the initial capital need to start a stall as a  hawker and as a school canteen stall. After that it does seem like net  profits remain fairly equal despite the increased operational costs.

A lot of school stalls seem go genuinely enjoy interacting with children/teens and seem to be the main motivation for most stall owners. While op seems to put this in a rather sacarstic way I believe it does capture a sense of frustration and regret that these people with the best of intentions are pressured heavily by self entitled parents and insensitive school leaders.

While I doubt every school and every hawker is in the same position I do believe that this is a brewing problem in the system that wouldn't be solved just by saying why don't you just move to hawker stall.

Usage of various ingredients also fluctuate week to week due to holidays/half-days/in-school event catering so sometimes that minimum amount cannot be met.

It sounds pretty rude to assume that just because you are a school canteen operator/worker you are therefore low-skilled and are incapable of picking up new skills. Also I just gave forex trading as an example at the top of my head, I don't expect most of them or most people for that matter to do it, but still some can and should.

Also, never did I suggest that they take up another job whilst being a school canteen operator/worker, I merely said they could do it as a side job, i.e. as like a student would taking a temp job during their holidays. Perhaps the word ""side job"" might not have been the right word for what I meant.

To be fair also, you made it sound like being a canteen operator/worker isn't a full-time job with all the non-school days being off days so you can't really expect them to rely on that job for sole income.

>In a coffee shop you can reasonably expect there to be 1 stall of each type with minimal overlap. A coffee shop or food court that allows 3 chicken rice stalls on site is just a dumb decision.

I don't know why are you talking about coffee shop when your original post was comparing to hawkers and this (being 3 of the same stalls) very well happens often. And even if you did want to compare with coffee shops, you do realise that coffee shops and food courts (I am assuming you are talking about the air conditioned ones) pay a higher rent right?

How long did you take to walk this trail? I’ve always wanted to walk it but I can’t gauge the time needed for it :(,2020-10-07 19:38:56
"I quite enjoyed it, but the middle part was the worst. In between Upper bukit timah and AMK was like rooaaaaaad",2020-10-07 19:49:10
"9 hours, 11 if including breaks. 

I walked from 11pm till 10am. 

It was aight, nothing too spectacular, nothing to be prepared for as well except for the leg aches that will happen the following day. just a lil bit of push and endure.

But the sengkang riverside park is the real killer.",2020-10-07 20:34:09
"I did it a few months ago solo. Maybe it's better now not sure.

* Agree 10-11 hrs seems to be about average, at a casual walking pace. There's a Youtube vid where they split up the walk into two days, which might be better for some people. I wanted to finish in one try since I knew I would not be able to pick up where I left off.
* I would also recommend doing it backward (from Coney --> Lakeside) as I find it much better to finish the trail closer to everything (MRT / food, etc)
* Bought a lunch before I started, then sat down in a park when I was hungry. I would recommend snacks. Lots of water.
* There's a Coast to Coast Trail app that's really bad (at the moment). Crashes constantly, the checkpoints are difficult to locate, and the map is pretty hard to use. I ended up using Google maps to find my way back to the trail a couple times.
* I tried to follow the signs and reach every checkpoint - but some of the signs don't make any sense, or are so ambiguously placed at intersections that you have no idea which direction to take. There are also some signs that will be one side of the road for a stretch and then randomly switch to the other side of the road for another. I wouldn't say it's hard to follow, but it's easy to miss a sign or two so that I had to check my map to see if I was still on the right path.
* The AMK stretch was indeed the worst - lots of road, lots of construction, and the sidewalk was more narrow than the rest.
* Had my Apple Watch with me - if anyone finds it relevant - I did it in around \~60,000 steps.

There's a lot that could be done to make the trail easier to navigate, but I'm happy Singapore has a designated and maintained trail to explore the city, and I'm happy I did it.  Something I wish more cities had.",2020-10-08 01:09:22
"Lots of walking by the road towards beauty world. Also the lakeside starting point is somewhat obscure, not worth making it there, just go to checkpoint 2 from the MRT. Didn't complete it though, it's actually pretty hard to complete it in half a day if you spend time exploring the landmarks along the trail.",2020-10-07 20:52:14
"I would love to re-walk the final stretch from Sengkang to Coney island again! The initial bukit batok park to bukit timah stretch was pretty nice too.

But we absolutely hated the Bishan/AMK stretch. Sparsely sheltered and hella boring. If not for the petrol kiosk at the end and the ice cool 100plus we would have given up then.",2020-10-07 21:22:39

I did this recently. Probably only do the jurong lake and the punggol segments. The other segments are mostly walking along the roads and you would be just seeing cars. Not recommended to do the full trail at one shot. I had muscle ache for two days. As always no pain no gain.,2020-10-07 21:45:16

How doable is it by bike? Are there a lot of roads to cross or stairs to climb? Thanks!,2020-10-08 01:17:10
"I did it once alone and once with friends. It's more fun with friends for the cocktalking along the way though didn't finish after 32km coz one got abrasion in sensitive area lol. I like the seng kang river part because there are fresh air, scenery and a lot of people and you know it's gonna end soon. I hate the parts in the beginning with pavement too near the road because there are too much cars and carbon monoxide. Will recommend people interested to try walking long distance a lot first and apply a lot of vaseline everywhere lol.",2020-10-08 08:22:33
"I’ve thought of doing it on my bike but I can’t take grab home when I reach the end. That means 72km two ways, and I’ve never ridden that far before on a bike. Not sure if I can do it or not.",2020-10-08 09:30:39
"i've done it before! but i had to split it into two days, because i was walking too slowly and due to wearing ankle socks, developed really bad blisters at the back of my foot :( 

did day2 in slippers and towards the last stretch to rower's bay i walked barefoot because it was just too painful.",2020-10-08 15:05:35

"Starting on YouTube is not that easy.

Everyone loves a rags to “riches” story. He already has an interesting storyline as the reporter has covered. But if he’d do it further on his own, he’ll need to invest in a camera and a computer with simple editing software. That outlay can easily cost him $500 upwards. Haven’t count in that he’ll need some basic video editing knowledge. And editing can sometimes take couple of hours for just a 5min clip.

by the way, there’s already a local GrabFood YouTuber, I think his content is pretty ok. I doubt he makes much if any, from YouTube compared to delivering food.

The only thing that is going to be a problem is with all the excess deliverymen when the virus thing falls over, but let’s face it, WFH is going to stay for a while and they will continue to make profits.

Saying “oh covid is fucking up my earnings” when it’s probably actually doing the exact opposite is just finding excuses. 

Yeah supply and demand, but with more deliverymen each deliveryman is earning a lot less because Grab hasn’t been redistributing their profits in the form of income to their deliverymen even in the wake of increased demand for its GrabFood services. 

Sure it’s all a business and running a business is about making money and minimizing your losses, but when you have other small businesses cooking free meals, giving out free masks, providing all sorts of free services as their service to the nation when they are obviously in much dire straits than Grab, it’s difficult as a Singaporean to look at them in a good light.

To put in perspective, if he raised deliverymen compensation, and said something like “hey we are gonna do shit this quarter because our deliverymen are essential to our survival and business, and we should compensate them more for the risk they take going everywhere, sorry that we are gonna tank a little this time”, then hey, he can say covid is his biggest crisis and people will be saying it’s okay, it’s fine, good job well done.",2020-04-23 18:33:38

"> # $7k a month as a food delivery rider?

> To save up for his wedding in December last year, GrabFood rider Muhammad Alif Mohd Jasmin worked seven days a week the month before.

> The 30-year-old says he made around $5,000 that month, clocking 30 trips a day.

> But while it is an achievable target, he cautions it is not sustainable in the long run.

> ""I had a motivation to achieve a target,"" he says.

> Mr Alif, who has been doing deliveries for GrabFood since late 2018, usually covers the town area and does 25 trips a day on his motorcycle.

> He targets to hit at least 15 orders from 8am to 2pm.

> ""Whatever I achieve after that is a bonus,"" he adds.

> With people staying home and more ordering food, hitting 20 deliveries a day is not hard these days.

> Earlier this week, food delivery platform Deliveroo reported that its top-earning rider raked in $7,095 last month. It explained that this would require the rider to work an average of 11 hours a day and earn an average of $21 an hour - more than the usual average of $17 an hour.

> Delivery partners whom The Sunday Times spoke to agree with Mr Alif that while it is possible to earn top dollar, the trade-off is one's health and well-being, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.

> Ms Sandy Lee, 32, who has been working for Foodpanda for two years, clocked about 27 trips a day during the year-end festive period.

> There is a price to pay... You will be very tired the next day and you could put your life in danger if you are rushing around too much. MS SANDY LEE, a Foodpanda rider who clocked about 27 trips in a day during the year-end festive period

> ""There is a price to pay,"" she says. ""I couldn't feel my feet. You will be very tired the next day and you could put your life in danger if you are rushing around too much.""

> On average, she does about 22 trips on her e-bicycle in a nine-hour day, earning about $6.50 an order.

> A Foodpanda spokesman says riders earn an average of $7.50 a delivery. With a surge in riders joining them during the pandemic, the company now has more than 8,000 riders.

> Grab's spokesman says it has recorded an 80 per cent increase in weekly applications to be a Grab delivery partner since last month.

> It launched islandwide delivery services earlier this month, which enable customers to order from almost 800 food and beverage establishments on GrabFood instead of just those in their vicinity.

> Deliveroo added more than 1,000 riders to its fleet this month. It now has more than 7,000 riders and expects to hire another 2,000 by the end of June.

> The platform has also seen 700 new restaurant sign-ups since January, with another 200 coming on board in the next two weeks.

> There has been recent controversy over whether food delivery platforms take ""too much"" commission from food orders. Many food outlets have also switched to doing their own deliveries or using third-party logistics providers.

> Delivery company Lalamove is now making more food delivery trips, says managing director Alex Lin, 34. These now make up 18 per cent of all its trips, compared with 8 per cent before Covid-19.

> But food delivery is still consid-ered a small portion of his business, he notes, as his company focuses more on logistics for healthcare and e-commerce. He has also seen an uptick in grocery deliveries.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Lalamove has about 8,000 active drivers, from a total pool of 30,000. Instead of charging a commission on the order, the company takes only ""slightly above 10 per cent"" from the delivery fee, which varies based on distance.

> It also allows users the option of adding a driver to their ""favourite"" list to continue to engage him for future deliveries.

> This has helped Lalamove driver George Li, 37, maintain a regular customer base. He works 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week, and earns up to $2,000 a week.

> It is about ""working smart"", he says, emphasising that good after-sales service is vital to retaining his regulars.

> Aside from making a living, what keeps the riders going in these trying times is more gratitude from customers in the form of tips.

> According to Grab, there was a 40 per cent increase in the practice of tipping last month, compared with the previous month.

> Mr Aaron Chuah, 39, a part-time delivery rider with Deliveroo, says it is heartening when customers show appreciation.

> ""A customer left a note outside the door with the words 'Stay safe' and a $5 note. A gesture like this means a lot to us.""

Am actually still studying, but I do it every day after school and on weekends. Don't really plan to switch to a different part-time job anytime soon.

"I actually have stopped a fight from happening before!

 I was waiting for an order from this Western stall. This mildly drunk man asked the worker at the Western stall for more plates. When the worker asked him how many people he needs the plates for, the man got angry and started shouting at the worker.  He got really agressive and started getting close to the worker. So I got up and stood between the worker and the drunk man, telling him to chill out. Really pitied the guy working there. Not gonna lie was kinda shitting myself",2019-08-18 15:38:15
"It's a mixed bag.

Some customers are kind, I had customers give me cold drinks or tips. Some customers give me the blackface if it takes a while to deliver their order, usually it's the merchant's fault for taking really long to prepare the order. I just have to lan lan suck thumb and wait for the food, then rush to send.

A lot of pedestrians give me the death stare even though I'm not riding my scooter dangerously. Some pedestrians walk on bicycle lanes get unhappy when I ring the bell or speed past them. 

You do get some looks from the general public, like they're judging you for doing this job.",2019-08-18 15:33:42
"I frequently check weather forecasts for rain.
 
But if I do get caught in the rain I'll try to speed to the customer as fast as possible. My escooter is not waterproof so if it really is a sudden heavy downpour I'll have to wait at a shelter and inform the customer I'll be late due to the rain.",2019-08-18 22:39:45
"It might take longer than just this week for them to process your application. It took them 3 weeks to be done with mine.

My PMD doesn't have an ignition key too. Tbh having an ignition key doesn't really help as an anti-theft measure. There has been several cases of riders having their PMDs stolen and most of the models were those with ignition keys. I usually don't have a need to lock my scooter as I'll be very close by to it when I'm working. You can bring a lock to lock your wheels if you're concerned. Also make sure to park in areas with CCTV or near other Grab riders.

I actually started with Foodpanda first. I realized that it got too crowded with riders haha. The area that I'm working in(North) always has the shifts fully booked. With Grabfood I don't have to book any shifts, and I still get a good amount of orders. Not to mention you have to provide an MC if you miss your Foodpanda shift. I'd recommend Foodpanda for someone looking to do it full-time, if part-time Grabfood is better. Also Foodpanda is notorious among riders to take ages to pay their salary, and many complained of incomplete payments.",2019-08-19 09:40:58
"Quite common, especially in the CBD.

I've had to send orders to shops at malls, office buildings like in the video, condos where I have to walk all the way into the complex, even big multi-story industrial complexes. It really wastes a lot of our time as we don't get paid hourly. I'll usually  try not to accept orders that require me to go to such places, unfortunately we have an acceptance rate that our incentives are based on so I can only do that once or twice.

If you order from an office with such security it would be nice for you to take the lift down and collect it from the rider :)",2019-08-19 19:22:20

"It's 50/50 I guess. Some riders use the halal bag as intended and some don't. I personally use it along with the cube bag. The cube bag is actually very useful because you do get large orders once in a while.

Sometimes Grab enforcement comes to check out riders and you'll probably have to lim kopi with Grab if you don't wear your uniform or bring the bags when you're working.",2019-08-19 09:49:50

The uncle supposedly threw the first blow. Then the two boys retaliated. One of the boys was shouting the uncle hit first. The girl trying to calm the uncle also said he shouldn't have punched first. The boys over-retaliated maybe, and kept throwing sucker punches when the uncle was keeping his distance and that's where most people are making their judgments from. Both parties did wrong, but the video does not include what the uncle did. Everyone keeps blaming the  boys. Don't be too one-sided about this.

"The problem with trying to answer this question is that there is a lot to unpack with underemployment. As you mentioned there are 3 types here each arising from different market phenomenon.

In my view. If we consider underemployment as a mismatch with fresh grad expectations to companies demand, this would show an unrealistic expectations for fresh graduates. This issue is compounded as fresh grad do not have any experience in the labor market and hence hard to determine their worth. Salary reports are naturally skewed towards higher income and many fresh grad do not want to be earning less than the median salary, although by definition half of them will.

The second type of mismatch is graduates not being able to use their skills or be forced to do task below their skillset. This reflects a slack in the labor market. In this case we could view underemployment as a transitioning phase where once the labor market tighten, people will change jobs to one they are a better fit.

A closely related phenomenon with the above case is also the third set of underemployment where people want to work longer but are curtailed to shorter hours. Again we can see this is akin to taking a job where skills are not utilized fully. And thus could say this is a market failure, where graduates need to adjust once the market recovers.

Bearing in mind all 3 cases can exist concurrently and in fact do. Like any economy, correcting for market failure typically require external influence. In this case, more information for fresh grads, better job matching, and a change in attitude on job switching.",2020-08-11 12:50:58

"Thanks for being the first person who use all the 3 types of underemployment I mentioned in your reply! ... Though the order is reversed.

>In my view. If we consider underemployment as a mismatch with fresh grad expectations to companies demand, this would show an __unrealistic expectations for fresh graduates. This issue is compounded as fresh grad do not have any experience in the labor market and hence hard to determine their worth.__

Let's begin with this statement. I think that fresh graduates face a huge issue, that is comparable with non-fresh graduates. Think about this scenario, if I'm a technician trying to move up to engineer role, but I don't have ""3 years of engineer experience"", am I going to stay as a technician forever? Or how about mid-career switchers? After retraining, they still won't have experience.

Some would say that fresh graduates lack not only experience, but soft skills or ""transferable skills"", but frankly, that's not hard to mediate. Training courses, whether in-house or external, whether self-paid or company-sponsored, or school-led initiatives willasily solve this issue.

>Salary reports are naturally skewed towards higher income and many fresh grad do not want to be earning less than the median salary, although by definition half of them will.

Median salary might refer to a band of salaries, and not necessarily mean half. But I digress. There are salary guides for university grads depending on progression and results and so on, I don't think they are hard to understand what salary to offer, because there have been a few decades of fresh grads looking for work... Unless you are referring to a new industry with radically different skills from existing industries.

>The second type of mismatch is graduates not being able to use their skills or be forced to do task below their skillset. This reflects a slack in the labor market. In this case we could view underemployment as a transitioning phase where once the labor market tighten, people will change jobs to one they are a better fit.

It depends on the industry, I think there is a slack in the labor market for some time in some industries. And age is an issue as well, so people might not be able to change jobs as easily as you think. And fresh grads would need additional assistance to find their first job, or else once they go into a different industry, it might be hard to return to the one they originally learnt, and thus be underemployed forever. A simple example is university grads driving grab full-time.

>A closely related phenomenon with the above case is also the third set of underemployment where people want to work longer but are curtailed to shorter hours. Again we can see this is akin to taking a job where skills are not utilized fully. And thus could say this is a market failure, where graduates need to adjust once the market recovers.

Um nope, I don't think this has to do with skills. It could be to do with company demand of manpower. Take the current COVID-19 situation affecting the airline industry and thus SIA has put many employees on furlough. They want to work but can't because market demand forced the company to reduce the number of hours worked by employees. There have been news of some companies reducing working days as well.

I agree, this is a market failure, and could recover once the market recovers. But some jobs might be lost forever.

>Bearing in mind all 3 cases can exist concurrently and in fact do. Like any economy, correcting for market failure typically require external influence. In this case, more information for fresh grads, better job matching, and a change in attitude on job switching.

You are right, but I sincerely hope that more can be done so graduates from any institution will be able to find long-lasting jobs that suit their profile, including skills learning proficiency, personality and so on. Yes, people can change their attitudes and so on, but people are not machines. We all have different personalities and tendencies, which is why horoscopes，MBTI etc. exist.

Recently, there are articles talking about how preparing students for the workforce has been, like some requiring them to go for internships before graduation. It's a move in the right direction and I hope more could be done so eventually a graduation ceremony is not the 'start of joblessness' for many students.

Lastly, there will definitely be market failures because of market intervention from time to time, especially in the last few months of Circuit Breaker. Correction needs to be fast and substantial to pull the free market back to work once lockdowns can be safely withdrawn. But for now, the domestic economy needs to expand at a fast pace in order to sustain the needs and wants of the 5.7 million people as of 2019 (as per Singstat).

"Yep actually I am just citing pre-COVID data.

By simple inference, one can guess that the current situation and post-COVID situation will be much worse for underemployment.

But given how the focus is more on unemployment and seemingly trying to keep people off the NEET (Not uin Education, Employment, or Training) path seems to be the utmost priority. And in that fervor, it is actually pushing people towards underemployment. In extraordinary circumstances like now, I can understand that is is inevitable. 

What I'm concerned however is that this situation already seems systematic and widespread before COVID-19. 

I'm actually very surprised as well because every once in a while I hear young people I know getting out of work and unable to find a job for months. And those are in their 20s, which is alarming because a few of them are not the having 'atas expectations' type, they just want to find a job from a course they studied in. And no, they don't study subjects like art and music, which are harder to find jobs in.",2020-08-11 22:31:41

You are right, people have different choices and preferences, whether in life or career progression.

I am concerned about people who have chosen the best choices they are offered with, yet are suffering from systematic (not arbitrary or figurative) factors that limit their potential in life.

And as with what I mentioned as the 3 types of underemployment, the first type (which is unable to find a full-time job) can be looked into and legislated more easily. After all, full-time jobs cover all industries, whether it be F&B, cleaning or the retail industry. 

Also, I know that the F&B, tourism and hospitality industries have long been a place for lowly-educated and people with special needs to work in. These are the industries that are severely impacted by COVID-19. I do believe it is important to focus on displaced workers, especially those which are more vulnerable, in order to prevent type 3 underemployment.

Legislation might not be the best choice to solve such problems, what's more important is to strengthen the social net and inform the people and organisations who have the power to help, to help. Like for example, NGOs.

"The gig economy pays better but everyone knows that it isn't likely a long-term job, like one that you can work to old age.

I think the mismatch comes because there usually is a range for any full-time permanent job position, and also whatever salary you accept could be a basis for your future job salaries. 

So yea, some people might find it hard to increase their salary if they start from a low base, especially their first jobs.

I think another part of mismatch is not the salary, but the work itself. Office politics and 'ad-hoc job matters' can play a huge part in it.

"> I am concerned about people who have chosen the best choices they are offered with, yet are suffering from systematic (not arbitrary or figurative) factors that limit their potential in life.

I don't think this describes reality. The fact of the matter is that there's significant underemployment in certain sectors, while other sectors (IT is a commonly cited example and is mentioned even in this thread) are having trouble even hiring enough staff. If everyone is making optimal and rational decisions, in the economic sense, why is this even happening? At the end of the day, people have preferences, and certain career paths are more attractive for various reasons. The market compensates by reducing salaries lower in these career paths as per supply and demand, and basic microeconomics suggests that in those career paths there will be an oversupply that will not be met by demand.

Of course, I am not dismissing underemployment as a problem. It is a problem that affects every economy, including ours, and possible solutions are very much worth discussing. I just don't think it makes any sense to buy into the mentality that those who are underemployed are often pure victims suffering grand injustice that they could not have avoided.",2020-08-12 06:57:15

"Because uni isn't supposed to be the place you go to to get ready for workforce. If you want to learn workforce skills, it's vocational education like poly/ITE/WSQ. However, Singaporeans have made these qualifications ""inferior"" to a degree, but by virtue of the outcomes of vocational training, it's really to prepare people for specialised skills in the workforce. Which is why there isn't a Computer Science diploma, it's Information Technology, which is an application of CS to the world.

Universities are tasked to teach the theories and concepts, not the tools of the trade. Concepts and theories are timeless (or at least, slowly changing due to the rigorous academic nature of making a theory into one), tools are not. It's like expecting a degree in Biology to teach you how to use this new-fangled microscope. A civil engineering degree to teach you how to use a concrete cube testing machine. Yes, a Poly/ITE course might do that, but not in uni. Uni would teach you WHY concrete testing is important, for instance.

It's your responsibility to utilise the skills/knowledge that the uni teaches you to learn and get up to speed with technology, hence why critical thinking is important. When a CS prof teaches you memoization, you won't use memoization libraries/framework blindly like a drone. CS prof teaches you the theory X (which has been around for ages) and you see the Python processing library and go, ""so this function would allow me to do theory X"".

This is the reason why Singaporeans lack critical thinking skills. They expect knowledge to be spoon-fed like as though they are mindless drones.

Going back to my FAANG post, FAANGs don't give a damn about what tools you know. In fact, you won't be able to know the tools they are using, since most of them are internally built tools/libraries (i.e. you need to work at Google to know how to use Google's tools). Their interviews are more or less along the lines of knowledge of theory and not practice, testing if you understand the concepts in CS. Once you're in, you are supposed to utilise the theory + skills learnt in uni (e.g. thinking) to ramp up on the tools/libraries they use.",2020-08-14 00:55:44

Food is done when it is safe to eat. Period. That is a hard fast rule. So cooks and cookbook authors naturally assume that somebody once determined that chicken and turkey are safe when the juices run clear. Once upon a time this may have been true. Sadly, nowadays, following this morsel of common wisdom can result in illness or badly overcooked meat.

Pink meat and thin pink juice in chicken, turkey, and even pork is due to a protein called myoglobin that is stored within the muscles and usually found mixed with water, making a pink fluid. It is not blood, which is dark red, and thick.

TLDR: chicken with clear juice can be undercooked and chicken with pink juice can be safe to eat depending on the ph of the meat.",2019-07-19 02:46:37

Their bones have not yet matured and are still somewhat soft and porous. As the internal temperature of the bird heats up, marrow can – and quite often does – seep through the soft bone into the surrounding meat. The result is bloody and/or red meat.

"Some hotels still have smoking rooms; you MIGHT be able to request for one if its available?  


(To clarify, some hotels designate a portion of guest rooms as 'smoking rooms' where smoking is allowed inside the guest room - usually just not allowed on the bed. Non-smokers can then request for 'non-smoking rooms' and won't be put off by the smell of cigs left over from the previous guest, and smokers can smoke in the comfort of their own room.)",2020-03-25 16:05:34

6. Why is this only available to returnees from the US/UK? Will the dedicated SHN 
hotels be expanded to include other high-risk countries like those in Europe? 

The UK and US account for the largest share of imported cases by far. We expect more 
residents, including a sizeable group of Singaporean students, to return from these countries 
over the coming weeks. To prevent potential spread of infection from the UK and US returnees 
to their family members, we will work with hotel operators to provide dedicated facilities for the 
returnees to serve their 14-day SHN. 
We have no plans to expand to more countries at the moment, based on the medical risk 
assessment.",2020-03-25 21:22:19

I think this is generally fair, but I worry about people who can't SHN at home because they have elderly relatives around and yet don't have the finances to go to a hotel. If they don't have wider family support (i.e. moving the aged relatives to another house for a fortnight) then this would be a difficult situation.

(Sidenote: you can request for 'contactless' food deliveries now - the rider will leave the food at the doorstep)

Agree that letting people roam free while waiting for test results is problematic.

If you don't wanna get disappointed, booking directly with the restaurant is always a little safer as well. Self pick-up and deliver to your grandpa is also doable since we're in Phase 2 of CB measures now. 

Also, I might've misunderstood your phrasing but you ordered food delivery to your grandpa yet you weren't going to eat together with him?",2020-06-21 19:27:29

"Yes, true that. The reason is it is problematic finding the driver rather than the restaurant. What happens if a restaurant makes the food but due to weather conditions grab cant find the delivery person?

Cause My grandfather does not live with me and we were ordering the meal to be delivered to his address...

Cause even through the app it would have been sincere since he knew of it and was communicating with us over the phone before then.

"But isn't the point of advance booking is to give them more time in advance to make all the necessary arrangements to make sure the order is confirmed and delivered and also give the customers reassurance that the order will be delivered. If what you're saying is right, then there is no point to use the advance booking anymore and everyone should just order at the last minute. 

There is obviously something wrong with Grab and this is one of the area they can improve on if they want to sustain and grow their business.",2020-06-22 07:31:35
You pasted this message in several subs,2020-06-21 15:44:42
That's why Grab should show that there are some advance orders at certain shop. Then the riders would know and they could choose to make the delivery early. If they choose that advance order then the riders could just hang around that area to consolidate even more orders. Rather than to release the advance orders so late and all the riders have to fight for it.,2020-06-22 12:54:10
"As a deliveroo rider (converted from grab) I cannot tell you how glad I am to hear that restaurants also feel that Deliveroo is the best.

Deliveroo's system is really quite smart - they can guage when the order will be done, and only call a rider near the ready time. Most times when I arrive at the restaurant I see the food either fully packed or already fully prepped and being packed. Makes for much greater efficiency on the rider and the restaurant side, and much lesser arguments about waiting time (this was the reason why I made the switch - with Grab I spent more time sitting at restaurants than actually being on the road).",2020-06-22 00:23:43
"I use Deliveroo 99% of the time and my experience has been largely good, but last weekend the rider delivered my dinner to the wrong address two nights in a row! I couldn’t contact the driver after the order had been delivered. Had to eat toast instead.",2020-06-22 11:26:54
"The driver marks it on the app that the food has been delivered. What sucks even more is that for our last order, the wrong house even accepted the order. 

It took about half an hour to get Grab to accept and issue a refund and by then it was too late to order and wait again for dinner. :(",2020-06-21 15:55:52

"I don't always hit $600 min monthly spending and don't always do groceries, so currently I am using cards with no min spending or lower spending limits:

* **Citi SMRT**: $300 spending gets me 5% at cinemas (specifically Cathay, Filmgarde), fast food, Popular, supermarkets (NTUC). 2.7%-3% for online spending (excludes travel-related sites). 0.7% for telco bill rebate. It's easy to convert SMRT$ to cash via SMS or using it as a direct rebate during bill settlement.
* **DBS SAFRA**: Mostly only for the SAFRA membership perks and utilizing the movie tix discount for Shaw (SAFRA) and GV (DBS/POSB).
* **SC Spree**: 2% for SimplyGo and other contactless spend that's better spent here than on Citi SMRT card. No min spending.

If I have to do some big purchase (e.g. overseas trip with family, buying furniture), I just look for any new card sign-up promotions that give extra cashback or rewards for having a qualifying spend of $x thousand in x months and typically there would be at least one for me to apply and use immediately.",2020-06-14 20:28:14

"In case anyone's interested, I applied for the UOB One, the American Express True Cash Back, the HSBC Advance and the DBS Live Fresh.

For Amex, I went to their website, authorized Singapore's MyInfo system, and never submitted another document or any other follow-up e-mail or form. On the third business day afterwards, I received a SMS telling me my application was approved and the card arrived in the mail same day.

For DBS and HSBC, I also received the DBS card and the HSBC card PIN (wonder where the card itself went) on the third business day (no SMS though). 

For UOB -- and UOB happened to have my payroll account for several years -- the application was pending for two months and they made several calls to ask me for more documents. This includes a physically signed form after I told them several times I was working from home with no printer or scanner, and a May 2020 payslip because the application had been pending so long it went past May.",2020-06-17 18:24:57
"> - UOB One card - gives you 5% if you spend SGD2,000/month for 3 consecutive months and 3.33% if you spend at least SGD500 for 3 consecutive months (but dealing with UOB is the most painful experience on the planet; this is a bank that will send you a SMS that they sent you a physical letter to ask you to send them an e-mail)

> - HSBC Advance - SGD150 on first SGD800 if you spend SGD800 in first month; 1.5% up to SGD70/month otherwise (2.5% if you are HSBC Advance client); 2.5% for dining, utility and telco bills with SGD2,000/month minimum spend (could be useful as a second card like the Amex True Cashback)

I don't recommend UOB One to most people, because they will _never_ achieve the maximum effective cashback rate of 3.33%/5% unless they track all their spend, and don't spend anything more on their card once they hit their desired tier.

HSBC Advance is probably the best cashback card for anyone that doesn't want to think too much — their Advance bank account isn't difficult to meet the criteria for to hit the 2.5% tier.

Note that it's also possible to redeem your rewards points as cashback — the rate is usually somewhere between 2% to 3% for any of the 10x points cards.",2020-06-15 04:09:10

Second, not sure why you would want to tie up SGD30,000 in a HSBC Advance bank account, make debit card transactions to qualify for the account etc. What exactly does the Advance account do other than give an extra 1% cashback, and would you be able to maximize the UOB One card anyway if you qualified for the HSBC Advance account?",2020-06-15 04:35:04

"> 
I'm actually pretty confused by the Maybank Visa Infinite.

It's 3 points per dollar on all local spend, which is redeemable at a rate of $50 per 17,000 points.

That works out to around 0.88% cashback.

I just read the article in full — it seems possible that one of the reasons author Tan Ooi Boon recommended the Maybank Visa Infinite card, was because one of their interviewees was Karen Low of Maybank. She somehow managed to suggest that card in one of the last few paragraphs.

Pretty much every bank (and there aren't that many in Singapore) allows for their reward points or miles to be redeemed as cash — the rate tends to be very bad.

For example, [DBS](https://rewards.dbs.com/Index.aspx?id=8) allows one to redeem $10 credit with 1,200 points. With an accelerated online spend card like DBS Women's World Mastercard (2 points per dollar of online spend), that would work out to 1.66% cashback on online transactions. The higher redemption tiers offer better rates, but most people end up redeeming those points as airline miles.

[UOB](https://pib.uob.com.sg/Rewards/), similarly, allows one to redeem $20 cash with 2,000 points. With an online spend card like the Preferred Platinum Visa, that would work out to effectively 2% cashback. (There's also $100 for 8,700 points, which works out to 2.29%.) Their PRVI cards would work out to a 0.8% cashback rate on all local spend — almost comparable to Maybank's Visa Infinite.

So while the Maybank Visa Infinite might be above average to redeem points to cash, I'd still consider that ST article quite shoddily researched.

(Source: I have an obsessive interest in trying to min-max spend.)",2020-06-15 04:07:38
"> First, a lot of people can surely consistently spend at least SGD500 or 1,000/month to hit the 3.33% cashback for the UOB One.

I guess it helps if one has bills to pay, or a substantial grocery budget for a family. And can spend the same amount over 3 months.

> I definitely tracked my big purchases to make sure I maximised that card and stopped when I hit the cap.

I do this too, but most people I discuss cards with mostly just want _one_ (maybe _two_) card(s) where they'll get ""the best"" rewards for their spend.

> Second, not sure why you would want to tie up SGD30,000 in a HSBC Advance bank account, make debit card transactions to qualify for the account etc.

One can just credit a salary/recurring deposit of $3,500 a month, and not maintain a balance.

> would you be able to maximize the UOB One card anyway if you qualified for the HSBC Advance account?

"Hello, grabfood rider here. I did foodpanda for a bit before switching over to grabfood. I like grabfood more because it's a lot more flexible. I can just work whenever I want and how long I want. With foodpanda you have to book shifts, and these shifts are hotly contested in high demand areas, so you'll have to camp at midnight or pray someone let's go of a shift. 

Also grabfood's app has much better UI than foodpanda. Foodpanda's app is just really leceh. You have to deal with the dispatchers who are from Malaysia or India and a lot of them are hopelessly incompetent. 

I'd just go for grabfood if I were you. I never tried deliveroo so can't comment on that. They all pay quite closely though, I don't think there's one that earns you a lot more money than the other

Edit: Also grabfood lets you cash out your earnings whenever you want as long as it's at least $50. With foodpanda you have to wait for your pay to come in about once every 2 weeks. Sometimes your pay doesn't come in and you have to create a ticket to deal with foodpanda hq. A big waste of time tbh.

"> # Shared-kitchen operator asks competition watchdog to help 'level the playing field'

> SINGAPORE - A shared-kitchen operator has appealed to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) to ""help level the playing field"" after being shut out by a second food delivery operator just weeks after starting business.

> Smart City Kitchens' general manager Warren Tseng said at a press conference on Wednesday (July 17) that Deliveroo and GrabFood - which it estimates to represent about 60 per cent of the online food delivery market here - have refused to list restaurants operating out of its Tampines kitchen on their platform.

> The 13,000 sq ft facility opened last month and houses 30 individual kitchens that are rented out to food and beverage operators for delivery operations.

> Smart City Kitchens, which touts itself as the first operator here that is not affiliated with a delivery service, offers advisory and facility services, but restaurants must find their own platforms for sale and delivery.

> The CCCS said in response to queries that it is ""looking into the matter"", but is unable to provide further details at this stage.

> Some eateries operating out of Smart City Kitchens told The Straits Times last week that food delivery giant Deliveroo had refused to list them on its platform, putting a dent in their expansion plans.

> The reason they were given was that Deliveroo had decided not to work with Smart City Kitchens.

> GrabFood has since followed suit, they said on Wednesday.

> In addition to providing delivery services for restaurant partners, Deliveroo operates three shared kitchens of its own. GrabFood said earlier this year that it planned to venture into the space as well.

> Related Story Eateries using shared kitchen say Deliveroo not listing them on platform

> Foodpanda, which has two shared kitchens in Singapore where its couriers deliver from a variety of brands, has continued to partner with those operating out of Smart City Kitchens.

> Grab said in response to queries that it is ""finding the most efficient way to adopt the cloud kitchen concept onto our platform, whether with partners or on our own"".

> ""We have spoken to merchants who have reached out to us and have explained that we are unable to serve them at present. However, we will explore other ways to support them on our platform in future,"" a spokesman said.

> Deliveroo said last week that it is ""evaluating what is in the best interests of our restaurant partners and customers"".

> Mr Tseng said the moves by Deliveroo and GrabFood ""go against the spirit of fair play and healthy competition"".

> ""This has severely affected at least seven tenants who had already started operations, and is deeply concerning to over 20 others who are due to commence operations over the coming weeks,"" he said.

> Smart City Kitchens, which is affiliated with former Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick, is going ahead with plans to open three more kitchens in Singapore by year end and to expand across South-east Asia, said Mr Tseng.

> He added that there are no ongoing discussions with either Deliveroo or Grab, and that the firm is exploring working with smaller players.

> Associate Professor Lawrence Loh of the NUS Business School said food delivery services have the prerogative to choose their suppliers.

> ""If the major food delivery services are ignoring the shared kitchens, other market takers will spring up to fill the gap,"" he said.

> But Dr Seshan Ramaswami, associate professor of marketing education at Singapore Management University, said Deliveroo and GrabFood's actions may be anti-competitive.

> ""If there are legitimate reasons, such as price negotiations falling through... then of course a delivery company can refuse to do business with a provider.""

> ""If it is done just to keep a competitor out, the action might well find some response from the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore,"" he said.

Surely as they own the platforms they should be able to choose who is allowed to use them?,2019-07-18 12:15:06
"I work for foodpanda as well and I feel that customers need to realise that once we pick up the order and press “pick up” on our app, it’s a race against time. There’s no incentive for us to take our own time because the faster we send this order, the faster we get another order, thus we earn more. But there may be certain delays such as the restaurant having many in-house diners. Trust me when I say that we feel the same as the customer who ordered when we are waiting for our order at the restaurant if it takes a long time. We will always strive to get to the customers’ house as quick and as safely as possible, through the best route and watching out for our own safety, as well as the safety of others. 

I’m glad that at least the vast majority of customers are very appreciative of our services and will at least smile and say thank you or even give tips.",2019-11-28 22:33:43
"I would also implore you, the delivery riders, to please understand us pedestrians as well.

I will admit that I also use the delivery apps sometimes. *Personally* I don't really care if the food arrives 5 or 10 minutes later. It is still faster than going out to eat. Of course I understand that there will be unreasonable people who will scream and shout if their food comes 1 minute late. No choice. That is the reality of working in any service line, you will always get people who act like that. Just ignore them and move on.

But what I *do* care about is my personal safety while outdoors. It is not just a matter of ""one rotten apple"" or a single isolated incident. Almost every day I have encountered close shaves when a speeding PMD rider wearing food delivery uniform whizzes past me on the footpath nearly hitting me. Today I just kena two near misses, considered average already. All it takes is for me to accidentally shift left or right a bit at the last moment and I would have gotten hit. I guess it is not a matter of if but when.

&nbsp;

It has gotten so bad that it is now a habit for me constantly to turn around to check for PMD every few seconds like some paranoid idiot. You know when was the last time I did something like this? It was when I was living in Europe and the US, where it was vital to check for potential criminals and troublemakers who might be following me especially at night. It was normal for everyone to do that in the cities I lived in, turning around every few seconds to check behind themselves. Both men and women. There was absolutely no sense of safety outdoors, and I was even thinking to myself how fortunate Singaporeans were to be able to feel safe on the streets at any time.

Never did I think I would end up doing the exact same thing - even in broad daylight - after coming back to Singapore.

But even then I cannot be turning around to check 100% of the time. Sometimes I am preoccupied with something else, sometimes I am on a call, sometimes I simply forget. And when I fail to check, that's when things might happen.

&nbsp;

I get it that the app companies are basically incentivising you all to speed and make deliveries as fast as possible. This is irresponsible of them and until they change their policy to stop incentivising speeding (perhaps by paying more per delivery while limiting the max deliveries per hour, or by paying a fixed rate per hour) the situation will never improve. But at the same time it is futile to expect them to change by themselves because that is essentially asking them to cut down their own profits.

But I guess as riders, if you don't want to be hated on by the public, please also do your part to ride **safely**. And more importantly, if you see your colleagues speeding or riding irresponsibly, please **call them out** and police each other's behaviour amongst yourselves. Do your part to remind each other often to ride safely and carefully.

Like I said, it is not a case of just ""one rotten apple"". I won't unreasonably claim that it's a majority of riders who speed and ride dangerously, but let us be clear that it is not just an insignificant minority either.

&nbsp;

Please understand how we feel. There is no longer any sense of safety on the streets for us.

Pro tip: Order just as you are starting to get hungry so you don't feel the pain of waiting. Most of the time the restaurants take forever to prepare, riders want to send it as fast as possible as we don't get paid by the hour.

"hey everyone,

I've always been walking on footpath since young. And only then did I realise how dangerous the footpaths had become ever since PMDs became prevalent. Before this footpaths are relative safer with exception of cyclist who travel at significantly lower speed. 

Now that many accidents has occurred and even death due to PMD accident, it's getting ridiculous. So on behalf of all pedestrians, please understand us and know that we just want to feel safe on the path and get to our destination safely. Some of us do not want to be constantly at risk and worrying about having to check our backs or actively avoid reckless PMD riders. Please don't let another pedestrian be unable to go home to their family anymore. 

Last but not least, do not take pedestrian for granted. If this carries on, PMD ban will definitely be permanent and will never be repealed.


...

Jokes aside, I do understand your viewpoint. but I find it totally ridiculous and a selfish stand.

""We try to abide the law as much as possible"" what does this mean? so if it meant doing more deliveries, you'll be willing to break the last and speed? Trying is not enough when it comes to this, IT MUST BE ENFORCED. 

""Please don't let one rotten apple ruin the whole basket"" I can throw it back at you, I'm sure most people are appreciative of y'all guys delivering the food to them, and those complains probably exists but not the bulk. So why judge us based off a small group of people? if you want to argue it isn't actually a small group that's complaining, where's your proof of that? Why am I taking all of your words for it? Then why can't you take all of our words for it when we say actually there are alot of riders speeding and endangering pedestrians? It is not one rotten apple, to be honest it's a huge bunch of rotten apples. Don't trivialize this problem. 

As someone else said amongst the replies, you guys are trying to make a living, but our LIVES are at stake, in fact there's already a death. y'all happily continue to close a blind eyes to your fellow reckless riders when many warnings and rules were given and set. But once it got worse and the ban came in, y'all start complaining there should be a trial and regulations instead. THERE ALREADY WAS, BUT Y'ALL COULDNT BOTHER TO FOLLOW OR REMIND EACH OTHER. who's fault is it really? The ban has kicked in, and I personally still see a huge bunch of riders using it on regular footpath recklessly. If they can't show that they can follow simple rules, what makes you think the public will support repealing this ban and setup some regulations to help them? 

I know delivering food is tough and you all have to do as much to earn as much. But cmon, who out there has their job easy? we resolve the issues on our own, or we suck it up. Limitations and regulations are always thrown to various jobs randomly, do we go out in masses and curse at volunteers or politicians? We work around it, even if it means we spend more time or earn less. If a factory got thrown a safety rule that affect their output by 30%, do they go shout and complain to the regulatory board that it's affecting their livelihood and it should not be in place? No, they find other ways to improve their process and increase output. This is the same here.

As mentioned just now, your livelihood is affected, but our lives are at stake. it may be difficult, but you guys can find another job, which may earn less. That's too bad, everyone faced this issue at some point, improve yourself and try your best to seek better opportunities. Relying on one source of income or one career path, esp one that's reliant on VC funding to sustain is not going work out for you in the long term anyway. But on the other hand, if we lose our lives, or get severely injured from your recklessness or stupidity, there's no second chance for us. 

you may think I'm heartless or ridiculous or whatever, but facts are facts, it's hard to accept or listen to, but too bad. It's not like everyone else out there don't face problems or issues with their jobs.",2019-11-29 07:48:34

Choose one.

Not making a joke out of this, i really feel bad for delivery riders who kena cause of the ban, but the ban is there for a reason. You said ""don't let a bad apple ruin the bunch"", thats assuming that all delivery riders always follow the speed limit and never ride dangerously.

Kind of defeats the purpose of pre-ordering in advance.",2019-11-29 13:27:27
"When I order, I simply add instructions to ""drop off the order at my door"" so I don't continue to monitor the order, and the deliverer can do so at his/her fastest own convenience.

You are talking about people who create, lead businesses/enterprises or for a better term, create assets. Or people who in general have the abundant mindset. To be honest, I can find them in all walks of life. 

As a counterbalance, it might disappoint you but a great many wealthy people in Singapore just got lucky during the good times from independence to the 90's due to purchasing/owning assets. Buffet said it the best, it takes a herculean effort to roll, say 5k to 1m, but after which you don't really need to do anything special to roll that first million into two million, etc.

The same problem exist in motor vehicles with regards to enforcement.

The difference though is that the gated barrier is the cost.

PMD has low cost of entry and ease of purchasing causing the users to have lowered sense of responsibility. 

Motor vehicles is high cost and tough entry. License, sellers are heavily regulated, penalties are another high cost. Thus users have elevated sense of responsibility.

4. No delivery jobs to be given to riders with non-compliant/non-registered devices. 
5. Devices are to be inspected regularly to ensure that they are not subsequently modified. 
6. Enforcement: LTA does the occasional spot-check, and if it catches non-compliant PMDs, to impose a fine on the rider.

" I keep seeing this comparison to other countries and having thought about whilst it works in theory, in reality it's not as suitable to be implemented here honestly. I see cities like NY, Paris, London being thrown out as examples. 

That's all well and good EXCEPT, even if the cycling paths there improve the traffic condition all 3 cities still experience SHIT TONS of traffic jams compared to us here. Also, why do people keep throwing stuff like bike lanes out so casually? Who's gonna pay for it? Who's gonna plan it? Cities like NY are grids which makes things infinitely easier to build from a pure road perspective. Whereas here in SG the only ""grid"" area you'll have is probably CBD. But that's not where majority of the danger to pedestrians are. It's in the heartlands, in the neighbourhoods. You can't just simply add bike lanes there without forgo-ing something else like small walkways or smaller roads, of which, many are already 2 lane- 2 way roads in those areas, so where exactly are you going to find the space from? 

We can't just blindly copy what other cities have done without considering the full picture and if anything our traffic situation and overall infrastructure are light years ahead of cities like NY, Paris and London",2019-11-13 12:01:03

"Hi Freelegendaries,

Just in case you are confused, there’s a difference between a ban in placed and the advisory period given.

The ban is in effect since 5 Nov 2019. This would means that PMDs are effectively banned from footpaths since the date stated. 

For the advisory period you were referring to, LTA has mentioned that users would be issued warnings to errant riders from now till end of the year. 

In conclusion, PMDs are still banned legally on footpaths since 5 Nov 2019 (which means you aren’t allowed to ride PMDs on footpaths).However, the consequence of getting caught is a warning till end of the year. This would means that you are effectively breaking a law but getting a flick on your hands for now . This however, doesn’t means you are legally allowed to continue riding PMD on footpaths. 

Please do not be mistaken or confused that riding PMDs on footpaths is allowed till end of the year. Thanks

I prefer to see this as a trial run where users are given free rein (for once) before regulation kicks in, also because there really isn’t a precedent to model after for PMD regulation. unlike say bike sharing where the G really fucked it all up overall. Ultimately the ban was the easiest solution for a complex issue wherein riders have been given multiple unheeded warnings to curb errant behaviour. Also much easier to enforce. The 7m was more of like an attempt to say “Hey we tried helping you” without much effort put in which i feel while it is rather ridiculous, there is no substitute or alternative in the gig economy that can be so flexible and pay reasonably well unfortunately.",2019-11-13 13:50:41

If you bought a good laptop just for work and later because ""(some) employees have been abusing it"", despite ""multiple unheeded warnings"", they're banned and you're forced to basically discard your perfectly functional laptop although *you* and many others never did anything wrong, are you actually saying that's good management?

"Number wan tip - use public transport.


Buy items that will last you for long.

Try and avoid the penny wise pound foolish mentality. 
Quality footwear, glasses, belts, even clothes will go through multiple wash cycles looking new-ish for long. My wife's jeans ripped this morning after close to a decade. I have tee shirt from 2005 still going strong :)
Same applies to non consumables such as water bottle, kitchen stuff etc. Not only buy good quality - buy stuff that's on promo offers. I bought some le creuset pans and masterchef series on sale and/or with points from fairprice & cold storage.



For consumables, buy it cheap from places that do cross border excess stock sale - our famous closing sales at value dollar & even the fancy place like honestbee habitat. They sell items upto 50% off a slightly pricy tag price.
Get your supplies from wet market if/when you can. They have good quality and env friendly too - not all wrapped in plastic individually.



Gifts - try your hand at arts & crafts. It is not easy (not me, but wife). Over time she's really talented now.


Drinks - carry bottle always. Don't need sugar drinks. Even coffee can da bao from home.

Cable/Internet/mobile(s) - get bundled offers or contracts. Locking down with one operator isn't a bad deal in itself - if the plan works for you.



Try and use the govt grants. Me and my kids are still using the activesg 100$ top up to pay for swimming pools. Me and the missus have enrolled for courses subsidised by govt for upskilling - upto 70% off, 90% off and it's valuable certs to add to CV. Use the free library app / library facilities.

"Eat Cai Png time need to be observant and see if there are traces of meat in a supposedly veg dish. they like to slip in some minced meat and trick u into thinking that is considered a veg dish and not a meat dish.

In office, bring power bank to charge. Then bring home no need to use own electricity to charge at home

When eat out with friends, always insist u pay first, so u can take advantage of them to earn miles, assuming your friends always pay u back. Even best if u have those restaurant membership that let u earn credits for next meal. If your group is big, the amount earn is possible to offset like 1/2 of your own next meal

Alternatively, when u eat at restaurant with friends, try to be the first few to enter. Then u can pick a seat furthest away from the side where the server will serve the dish. Least chance the bill will be placed there and u can di gong let someone else pay, after that pretend to forget and get a free meal

Eat at restaurant bring your own water bottle, so no need to order the overpriced drinks. Best is u use an opaque bottle, so u can even put soft drinks bought from NTUC inside and the staff wun suspect

Again at restaurant, if ur friend order an expensive dish dun ever touch that dish. So when he calculate bill time u make known to him u never eat that dish and u shld not be asked to share the cost. Using this trick, it's possible to pay only $5 for a restaurant meal, assuming u eat only white rice, plus only 1 or 2 cheap dish. Then if possible say u no cash and di gong until they forget. Tell them u no payNow or PayLah so they cannot trick u into using payNow to settle your portion on the spot. Using this trick, it's possible to save very substantially on food

*Second, a control order and any amendment must be presented to Parliament as soon as possible after its publication in the Gazette.""* So it doesn't seem to take effect immediately after the Act comes into force, but I doubt the Govt will dither -- they'll probably make the control order fairly quickly, though the Minister is required to ""publish the control order so that those affected are aware of it, in addition to publishing it in the Gazette."" before enforcement.",2020-04-07 23:30:08

> Once I finished my NS, while waiting for uni to start, I decided to look for full-time jobs while doing some part time work with the boss I know. While I was working part time, I didn't think I was earning a sufficient income, so I decided to do Grabfood via cycling. For some background, I'm a PES C soldier who has done only admin work for the past 2 years, with minimal exercise, so when I cycled with my bike for just 2 trips, I was dead. My legs couldnt move, I was heaving and had heart palpitations. As a result, I decided to spend the rest of my savings, which amounted to 700ish, on a PMD. 
> 
> I bought it on 19th Oct, and registered it on the 20th. In order to ride a PMD in Singapore, you gotta register a PMD right? Fine, I did all the paper work, and bought a sticker that displays my license number. LTA informed me through messaging that I have to affix the LTA registration mark by 3rd Nov, meanwhile I could still ride in public before 3rd Nov.  During this time, even though I was on a cycling GrabFood account, I did a few deliveries using my PMD. Grab requires the LTA Registration Mark before allowing you to have a PMD GrabFood account
> 
> I called LTA and enquired, and was told that ""it takes a couple of working days, usually less than a week"" (Please remember this part of the story). I didn't know it was against Grab's terms of service to use a PMD while on a cycling account, and I got caught by some Grab employees for breaking the ToS. I explained to them that in order to register, I need a LTA registration mark, which I do not have yet. Grab suspended me for 1 week (23rd OCT- 1st NOV). Fine, I guess I'll just take a weeks break from Grab and wait patiently for my LTA registration mark to come.
> 
> On 1st Nov, I still hadn't received the LTA registration mark, and my ban from Grab was lifted, so I called LTA and asked them about the status of my LTA Registration Mark. They said everything was approved but need to wait a couple of days. FINE. Its been a week, what more is a couple of days right? 4th Nov comes and there were announcements of the ban, that all PMD are banned from footpaths on 5th November. I was really pissed. I literally owned my PMD for less than a month now it cant even leave my own house unless I push it. FINE. 
> 
> So I called on that day to ask about the full details about the ban, and the status of my registration mark, and still they told me it will be on the way. WTF? okay fine. Then recently on Monday I read the news about the conversion scheme from the government that there will be grants provided to assist PMD riders to convert from to bicycles. I was kinda half happy that my PMD wasnt gonna be a $700 piece of scrap metal until I read ELIGIBLE FOR FOOD DELIVERERS REGISTERED PMD USERS ONLY from 5 NOV ONLY. Okay, Fuck. What do I do now? So I called LTA again (it was monday), I asked about the conversion from the LTA hotline. 
> 
> I told him my entire story, and the dude literally told me he doesn't fucking know. Word for word ""This conversion thing I am also not really sure, it's a new thing I don't know how to advise you on that."" I told him my story, I bought my PMD way before the ban, and the time frame to get my registration mark was delayed way longer than the time frame given to me. Since I didn't have my registration mark, I couldn't register to Grab to become a PMD food deliverer. And NOW YOU TOLD ME YOU DONT KNOW? He told me he would escalate the situation, and will update me yesterday. My phone was radio silent yesterday, so I called in today and they told me the same fucking thing they did on Monday. I am so damn pissed off.
> 
> Okay, firstly the ban was so sudden, no notice ban. I have no way to react and no amount of foresight would have prepared me for this. Second, my $700 paperweight is not even properly registered so it cant leave the house now, despite me doing everything right, everything was delayed on LTA's end.

"No, im not going to try to ask for a repeal this ban whatsoever because it is justified. Footpaths belongs to pedestrians and their safety should be a priority. Food deliverers should not have special concessions to ride on footpaths while the rest of the public cant. The issue right here is the lack of buffer time from the announcement and implementation of ban. Why this is important is because a food deliverer wants to transition to motorbike, they need to hold the license for at least a year in order to register to be a rider. And since regulations for mobility devices (PMD, PAB) is so volatile, I dont think anyone should invest more money into them. Hence it is not very viable",2019-11-14 14:46:01

"The cafes/eateries that are available through the apps/channels (except Chope) stated by the OP are generally mediocre. Not sure if there is any value in going to mediocre places even though you get 40% off?

&#x200B;

My tips for dining well and relatively cheaply at good restaurants are:

&#x200B;

(1) Go for lunch as their set meals are generally about S$50. The items they serve tend to be the same as dinner / a la carte menu.

(2) When you go for dinner, avoid ordering this kind of appetizers because they tend to have small portions: - salads, soups, shellfishes (especially scallops and oysters; sometimes mussels are okay in portions), octopus and tartar (any sort).

(3)These appetizers tend to have bigger portions and can be as big as mains: charcuterie, cheese plate, pate and bread, pasta, fish (unless its a tartar).

(4) If you like to drink, order by the bottle instead of by the glass. If you want to order by the glass, order a cocktail unless the wines served by the glass are very cheap.

(5) When ordering mains, avoid ordering poultry unless you are sure of the size. Otherwise the portions are usually quite small. In nice restaurants, chicken is usually 1/4 size and quail is usually 1/2 size. Duck breast are very small and you usually have one piece.

(6) Avoid ordering desserts. They tend to be priced like appetizers and have even smaller portion. If I really want to have dessert, I tend to order ice cream by the scoop (if available) and even the fanciest place charge not more than S$10.

&#x200B;

Chope is quite good because of the credits you earn. The heavy discounts are usually for rubbish places.

&#x200B;

Its very expensive to run a good restaurants and profit margins are terrible. A good and efficient restaurant does 10% gross profit margin. The reason why they can offer 40% offer is because the restaurants usually hope that they can make up for it through (i) return business; and (ii) sales of drinks / alcohol.",2019-06-28 11:09:11
"While the guide is great, spending $30 on a discounted $60 meal is not saving $30, but still spending $30. Unless you have already budgeted or planned to eat that $60 meal even before discount.

That AMEX platinum (\~600 annual fee) is probably your best bet for those.

What I want to do here, is to share a set of tools that can reduce the cost for eating out. I'm not giving any tips on how to order food because that is highly situational.

"Various species of softshell turtles are heavily exploited for food and the pet trade, and as a result, several species not native to Singapore have been recorded from the wild here.

**[Chinese Softshell Turtle](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/turtles/chinese-soft-shell_turtle.htm) (*Pelodiscus sinensis*)**

These days, if you order turtle soup from the stalls in say, Chinatown or Geylang, you're eating Chinese Softshell Turtle. Hailing from temperate East Asia, the Chinese Softshell Turtle reaches up to 25 centimetres in carapace length. Large numbers are raised on farms in China for human consumption, and today, the market for turtle meat in Singapore mostly relies on imported Chinese Softshell Turtles. These are usually imported live, and slaughtered just before consumption. In the 1970s, there were also attempts to raise Chinese Softshell Turtles in local farms, although considering that there are no turtle farms in Singapore now, it appears that this did not really take off. While this species can be legally imported and traded for food, it is not allowed to be sold as a pet. However, hatchlings are sometimes still seen for sale in aquarium shops.

This is actually the most commonly seen softshell turtle in Singapore today. Sightings of Chinese Softshell Turtles [in various locations](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2014-264.pdf) around Singapore, mostly in our reservoirs, and ponds in urban parks and gardens, represent individuals that have escaped or were released by people, although it is not known if this species has managed to breed in Singapore.

The Chinese Softshell Turtle has traditionally been considered to have a very wide range across East Asia, from the Russian Far East and Korean Peninsula to Japan, China, and Vietnam. However, *Pelodiscus sinensis* has since been recognised to [be a species complex](http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Articles/Fritz_etal_2010b.pdf), and [more species have been identified](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1439-0469.2011.00632.x) in recent years. Instead of a single wide-ranging species, there are now at least [five distinct species](https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/31376/) of *Pelodiscus*, and all are threatened in the wild to some extent, especially by hunting and habitat loss. Although large numbers of these turtles are raised on farms in China, this is actually a problem, as different species of *Pelodiscus* are being kept together, [leading to hybridisation](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s00114-018-1558-9). If species not native to a particular area or hybrids end up in the wild, this could further threaten native populations due to competition and cross-breeding. Whether the Chinese Softshell Turtles in Singapore are exclusively 'true' *Pelodiscus sinensis* or include some of the other species, such as Northern Chinese Softshell Turtle (Pelodiscus maackii*) or Lesser Chinese Softshell Turtle (*Pelodiscus parviformis*), is unknown.

**[Asian Softshell Turtle](https://flic.kr/p/6eFqv6) (*Amyda ornata*)**

As mentioned earlier, the Asian Softshell Turtle has been split into two species, with the populations in Sumatra, Borneo, and Java retaining the name *Amyda cartilaginea*, while the populations from the northeast Indian subcontinent, Myanmar, Thailand and Indochina are now known as *Amyda ornata*. This has not been universally accepted, and common names have yet to be coined to reflect this split. For now, the native Asian Softshell Turtle populations of Singapore are assumed to be *Amyda cartilaginea*, but confirming this will require further research. However, there have been [sightings of individuals](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2015-122.pdf) that appear to be more similar to those from Thailand and Indochina, especially in rural areas outside of the Central Catchment Area, and so these are thought to be examples of *Amyda ornata*, brought into Singapore for food or the pet trade, and then released by people.

**[Wattle-necked Softshell Turtle](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/species/wattle-necked-softshell-turtle/) (*Palea steindachneri*)**

This species is native to southern China and Vietnam, and is also heavily exploited for food. It has a carapace length of more than 40 centimetres. In June 2012, a large softshell turtle was [found on Tyersall Avenue](http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/news2/2012/16072012-rareturtle.pdf), near the Botanic Gardens. It might have been run over by a vehicle, as it had a cracked carapace. ACRES rescued the turtle, and identified it as a Wattle-necked Softshell Turtle, but it died from its injuries. This individual was likely another turtle that was illegally imported and then escaped or released.

**[Indian Flapshell Turtle](https://flic.kr/p/QjpiSf) (*Lissemys punctata*)**

This species is native to the Indian subcontinent, and has a carapace of up to 37 centimetres. Members of this genus are easily recognised by having [moveable flaps of skin](http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Accounts/crm_5_076_punctata_v1_2014.pdf) attached to the plastron, which can close to protect the hind legs. The front part of the plastron is also flexible, and covers the head and front legs when they are retracted.

In May 1990, a skeleton of a softshell turtle was found along the bank at Upper Seletar Reservoir, and recognised as [belonging to an Indian Flapshell Turtle](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/38rbz027-030.pdf). However, the skeleton was subsequently re-identified as that of an Asian Softshell Turtle. But in August 2001, a live Indian Flapshell Turtle was [caught in a pond in Kranji](https://sci-hub.se/10.1142/S0219607710000516), confirming that at least one individual of this species had been imported and released in Singapore.",2019-08-28 18:48:45

"Softshell turtles are called 王八 in chinese and it is mistakenly thought in ancient China that the female softshell turtles reproduce asexually and thus 王八蛋 softshell turtle egg became an insult.

"**[Fly River Turtle](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/species/pig-nosed-turtle/) (*Carettochelys insculpta*)**

This [entirely aquatic species](https://youtu.be/D7ua5oBazmg) is not a softshell turtle, but is the sole surviving representative of a closely related family. Like the softshell turtles, it too has a shell covered in leathery skin instead of scutes, and a long snout, which gives it the alternative common name of [Pig-nosed Turtle](http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Accounts/crm_5_009_insculpta_v1_2008.pdf). However, its shell is made up entirely of bone, like most other turtles, and is not flexible. Uniquely among turtles that live in freshwater ecosystems, its limbs are modified into flippers like those of a sea turtle. 

The Fly River Turtle is native to rivers and swamps of southern New Guinea (including the Fly River drainage), and parts of Australia's Northern Territory. Like many turtles, this species is omnivorous, but consumes more plant matter than animals. Fruits and leaves from trees growing along the water's edge are an important part of the diet of wild Fly River Turtles, and some populations are known to rely on aquatic plants. Animal prey include aquatic invertebrates such as insects, crustaceans, and molluscs, while fishes and carrion are also eaten.

Fly River Turtles are heavily exploited, both for food and [the international pet trade](https://www.traffic.org/site/assets/files/8647/pig-nosed-turtle.pdf). In 2005, [in an attempt](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/13/prop/E13-P21.pdf) to manage the trade in this species and [reduce overexploitation](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/13/prop/E13-P22.pdf), it was listed on [Appendix II](https://www.cites.org/eng/app/index.php) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), meaning that all international trade in the Fly River Turtle was regulated and subject to permits. However, even today, large numbers of eggs are collected from the wild and incubated, with the hatchlings being exported or [smuggled](https://www.traffic.org/publications/reports/assessing-the-trade-in-pig-nosed-turtles-in-papua-indonesia/) to other countries, often falsely passed off as 'captive-bred'. It's not uncommon to hear of customs officials [stopping smuggling attempts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-wildlife/malaysia-seizes-3300-rare-turtles-in-suspected-trafficking-case-idUSKCN1QG18G) and seizing [thousands of young Fly River Turtles](https://www.traffic.org/news/large-seizures-of-protected-pig-nosed-turtles-in-indonesia-highlight-magnitude-of-illegal-trade/) in a single case.

In Singapore, juvenile Fly River Turtles used to be quite commonly seen for sale in aquarium shops. After 2005, all trade in this species has been banned, since this species is not included on the list of animals that can be sold as pets here, and nobody has a permit to legally import Fly River Turtles into Singapore. However, the Fly River Turtle still kept [popping up in the shops for some time](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C9FF6CB000BAFB52A91B0C0B4B24BF9B/S003060530700155Xa.pdf/are-tortoises-and-freshwater-turtles-still-traded-illegally-as-pets-in-singapore.pdf), until AVA finally started enforcing the ban. There are some people in Singapore who still own Fly River Turtles as pets, but they are allowed to keep them as long as these turtles have a carapace length of more than 20 centimetres, since these represent turtles that were imported before 2005.

Abandoned Fly River Turtles have been [appearing in the wild](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2015-162.pdf) in some of our reservoirs, lakes, and ponds. Considering that this species can reach a maximum carapace length of 55 centimetres, it is not surprising that many people who buy one as an [adorable little juvenile](https://youtu.be/1H3qI_CYllE) eventually realise how much space these turtles actually require, and opt to dump their pet in the nearest lake or pond.",2019-08-28 23:11:12

"**[Asian Giant Softshell Turtle](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/species/cantors-giant-softshell/) (*Pelochelys cantorii*)**

This is a very large species, with a carapace that can reach 100 centimetres in length. It is often listed as formerly being present in Singapore, although there do not seem to be any official records or museum specimens. Regardless, as it is widespread across South and Southeast Asia, from the Indian subcontinent to Thailand, Indochina, southern China, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Philippines, it is possible that it also once occurred here. 

The Asian Giant Softshell Turtle inhabits lakes and rivers, but appears to be able to adapt to brackish and even marine environments, as it has also been recorded from coastal waters, and is known to nest on beaches. With its [flattened shell](https://www.joelsartore.com/ani104-00043/), and [tiny eyes](https://www.joelsartore.com/ani104-00045/) located close to the tip of the snout, it truly is a bizarre-looking creature.

Many older references considered *Pelochelys cantorii* to be synonymous with *Pelochelys bibroni*, but the [Asian Giant Softshell Turtle](http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Accounts/crm_5_011_cantorii_v1_2008.pdf) is now recognised as a distinct species; *Pelochelys bibroni* is endemic to the rivers of southern New Guinea, and has the common name of Southern New Guinea Giant Softshell Turtle.

Like so many turtle species in Asia, the Asian Giant Softshell Turtle is under threat from hunting, collection of eggs, and habitat loss. There is an important conservation programme for this species [in Cambodia](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/04/cantors-soft-shell-turtles-recovering-cambodia/).

**[Asian Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/species/southeast-asian-narrow-headed-softshell-turtle/) (*Chitra chitra*)**

This is another huge species; with a reported carapace length of more than 1.2 metres, this is a contender for the world's largest freshwater turtle. Like the Asian Giant Softshell Turtle, this turtle also has a [strange appearance](https://www.joelsartore.com/ani080-00376/), with tiny eyes located [very close to the tip of the snout](https://www.joelsartore.com/ani080-00374/).

This species inhabits large rivers with clear waters and sandy bottoms in Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, but has never been recorded from Singapore. It appears to be exclusively carnivorous, [burying itself in the sand](https://youtu.be/uQGazGGkl7A) and ambushing prey such as fishes, crustaceans. Threatened by hunting, egg collection, pollution, dams, and habitat loss, the Asian Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle is now considered [Critically Endangered](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/4695/97399248), and is included in [Turtles in Trouble: The World's 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles](http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Top%2025/Turtle_Conservation_Coalition_2018_Top_25+_Turtles_in_Trouble_lr.pdf).

"Seems like it was quite an ancient split; turtles first appear in the fossil record in the Triassic, but there are fossils of what are believed to be early softshell turtles [in the Early Cretaceous](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316089920_A_review_of_the_fossil_record_of_Old_World_turtles_of_the_clade_Pan-Trionychidae); it appears that softshell turtles originated in Asia, then spread to the other continents during the Cretaceous Period, and were among those that survived the mass extinction that killed off the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. So yeah, you can imagine a pond or lake at the end of the Cretaceous period, with *Tyrannosaurus* or *Triceratops* drinking along the edges, and softshell turtles basking and swimming alongside them.

Representatives of other turtle families, such as sea turtles and snapping turtles, were already present during the Cretaceous, but other groups, such as tortoises and pond turtles, appear to have diversified only after the mass extinction event. Quite a number of turtle families that are represented in the fossil record of the Jurassic and Cretaceous eventually went extinct, but based on what we know about how the different families are related to each other, early members of all our modern-day groups must have already been present at least since the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago).",2019-08-29 12:24:36

"I did lose a few kilos with this, in a week. In fact, I did lose about 3~4 kg in this week alone. I understand that the initial quick weight loss is due to the water being locked up when I eat carbs. The actual fat loss may be about 1kg per week if you are overweight which is pretty good compared to any diet strategies and I didn't even count calories nor do I want to.

As for the mind, it's more of my mind isn't being addled rather than it being sharper than normal. This supposed sharper mind is the norm for our caveman ancestors who ate this way due to the lack of food availability. It's very stable, no ups and downs in energy because you are literally burning your own fat for energy.


If you want to try it, my recommendation is to ease into the fasting. Doesn't matter how much you eat, the important point is to stick to the habit of eating in a certain window. Once you get into the habit, you will find it easy to stick to it and your hunger decreases along with it.",2019-01-17 22:29:17

In fact, the fasting allows me to have the energy to concentrate throughout the day, assuming that I slept enough of course. That's probably what people meant by sharper mind when on keto or fasting. ",2019-01-18 08:20:45
"My body got adapted to burning fat for fuel rather then being dependent on carbs. Your body can store very limited about of energy from carbs in the form of glycogen and that can last you about a day. Eating keto forces you to abstain from carbs and burn fat for energy, takes a few weeks to adapt. You will feel the withdrawal symptoms from not eating carbs. After all. you are forcing your body to do something that it hasn't done since you were a baby. Once you get adapted, you won't suffer any ill effects or dips in energy. Fat is a very stable source of energy and your brain can run on mostly ketones which are broken down from fat.


If you think that you will die after a few days without food, think about how people can survive weeks being stranded without food. A day is completely doable. You can drink coffee to help suppress hunger but only coffee powder and water, no sugar or cream at all. Those make you ravenously hungry.",2019-01-19 09:52:20

"Hmm, not true. Pasteurisation was in Japan since Heian era (794-1185), while Tamago-kake-gohan was only invented in Edo era (1603-1868). Of course, this doesn't naturally assumes that the first guy who invented Tamago-kake-gohan used pasteurised eggs.  
  
Next, we look at history of salmonella. Salmonella really only became a problem due to battery farming - large scale industrial farming of chickens. Hens in cages are conducive for bacteria growth. So.. people of the Edo era probably could get away with raw eggs that weren't pasteurised.  
  
But of course, my stance is personally, I wouldn't find this bit of cost savings worth the risk.",2019-01-17 20:37:23
"Yeah.. I don’t eat 100% raw eggs all the time - only when I do tamago-kake-gohan. Soft boiled / poached / runny style, I’ll still use normal eggs. So it really doesn’t make sense to me to want to save that amount of money.",2019-01-18 00:16:19

May I quote from your recommended source, [NEA Guideline on Good Handling of Eggs](https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/our-services/guidelines-on-good-handling-of-eggs.pdf).. Point 4(a) mentioned to “use pasteurised eggs instead of shell eggs, especially for food that would be lightly-cooked or uncooked. For example, mayonnaise, cream, icing, mousse, tiramisu and other desserts which contain eggs.”

"Life of OP

It is 10am. OP's eyes open wide and sudden and he suffers a mild heart attack. 3 seconds later he relaxes when he realizes he hasn't had a job in over six months and he can wake up at any damn time he pleases. He walks over to the toilet with a slight limp; the Pink Dot after-party was still taking its toll on him physically. He takes a 1kg shit in 0.5 seconds. New world record.

OP squats in front of his computer and goes straight to Reddit. He browses post after post bashing the government- perhaps there is some way he could exploit this trend for karma? He starts to think, but finds it hard to concentrate with his mother screaming ""yes daddy, harder daddy"" across the hall. He shuts his door. Better.

""I know! I'll write a fictional story about those shitty Ministers- and I'll call them GAY! That'll show them!!"" his eyes light up like he has just stumbled upon the cure for cancer. He starts typing furiously, as if possessed by the ghosts of a hundred Primary School boys who think gay humor is top shelf stuff. 

He sits back, and re-reads his work. ""This is.. a masterpiece,"" he whispers to himself. It's really not. In reality, it is low-tier satire using the lowest of the low-hanging fruit of comedy. But that's okay, because it's good enough for Reddit. 

That night, as he lies in bed, he thinks about how his masterpiece is probably going to be made into the world's most hilarious movie. Because evidently it is movie material. He smiles to himself, and assumes his typical sleeping posture- curled up in the fetal position, with one finger in his butt and the other in his mouth.

"It seems like blind snakes still use their tongues to pick up chemical cues; they must be very sensitive to say, the pheromones and other scents that ants and termites use to navigate and communicate.

I found [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/41/6/1321/241369) that looked at blind snake feeding behaviour in captive settings (in comparison with another similar family, the thread snakes), and it had this to say:

> ... *Typhlops* and *Rhinotyphlops* exhibited somewhat frenzied feeding behavior when presented with ant brood. Soon after a snake detected the presence of prey (presumably via chemosensory cues obtained through tongue-flicking), it initiated a tactile search for individual prey items by rapidly sweeping its head from side to side in an erratic fashion as it progressed forward. Once the snake's head contacted an ant larva or pupa, the snake maneuvered its head so that its mouth was positioned directly over the prey. The snake would then open its mouth to initiate capture and ingestion.

"Before I share my experience, just to clarify that it is my first time to any HHN.

Went on 29th Sept (Sat), peak day according to HHN's calendar.

Me and my bf went in slightly later than 7.30pm, and there wasn't any queue to enter the park. The opening show was okay (agreed with OP, it felt more like an EDM fest and being a EDM fest junkie I got hyped for the wrong reason lol). Since we went in late so we were standing somewhere in the middle of the crowd, and me being short I could barely see what's going on at the stage.

Anyway, once the gates are released we headed against the majority crowd's flow and went to the left from the main stage for Pagoda of Peril. Lines are 20-30mins tops. Proceeded to Pontianak after that, line was okayish ~30mins? Cant remember.

It was already 8pm+ by then and most of the houses are showing ~60-120mins waiting time. Proceeded to take on CYLON and check out the scare zones. By 9pm+ we headed for Stranger Things which has the longest queue time for me that night (120mins on the waiting time board). Took us about 45mins to enter and by the time we're done with ST it was only 10pm.

Walked around, chill, checked out some merch stores etc. Entered the Phantages around 10.30pm for the DeadTalk show at 10.45pm. By 11.10pm it was done and we proceeded to complete the remaining 2 houses, both took no more than 5 mins to enter. By 12am we are done with all houses and even managed to catch more rides along the way.

Spent walking around, chilling, grabbed a cuppa and took some photos, took more rides etc etc. By this time the crowd is waaay lesser so everything was a breeze. Went for the Shrek movie thingy at 1am, done by 1.25am. Could even make it for one last ride after that to conclude our night at HHN. Left the place at ~1.40am.

Overall we managed to cover:-
* All 5 haunted house
* All 2 scare zones
* 2 out of 3 shows (missed out on Blood & Bones)
* Cylon
* Puss in Boots
* Transformers
* Enchanted Castle

Overall we think it was better than our daytime USS experience as the queue is waaay shorter during HHN and the weather is also better than the sunny daytime. Then again, it was our first HHN so can't compare much but we did enjoyed ourselves albeit there are some areas which can still be improved.

"Went on 5 Oct Fri night. It was actually ok. I didn’t queue over 40 minutes for any rides or haunted house...

Went in at 8+pm, stroll around the place. We basically only go to places where the waiting time is within 60 minutes. If the waiting time indicated is more than 60minutes, we will just move on to the next place. 

For haunted house, we realized if the waiting time is 60min, actual waiting time turns out to be less than 40min. The longest waiting time was 35 -45 minutes for stranger thing and cyclone.The other haunted houses were some 15 to 25 minutes, transformer and battlestar human were 5 minutes. 

We roam around mindlessly with no plans and before we knew it, it was 1am already. Half way we even had time to get some snacks in one of the cafe.

And towards the end of the night, they became very manageable (Killuminati was listed at 5 minutes when we got there). 

Pontianak had a 10 minute wait when we got there and it was the best house of the night. What really sold it was the more claustrophobic environment, creative jump scares, and darker/dimmer lighting. 

With that being said, Stranger Things and the Japanese one had quite long lines. And waiting in the rain and humidity wasn’t a great experience. ",2018-10-13 03:33:35

"😘 Hey people, these days a lot of people are starting to use Telegram as their main messaging app, Telegram has a lot of features that beats Whatsapp hands down. Telegram already has over 200 million active users, that’s 40 times the population of Singapore! Moreover, groups that can contain up to 100K members interacting and chatting, like a IRC but way better with BOT features and Stickers (there’s even a Yanxi Palace Sticker OMG!)! Also, with Announcement channels, one can also subscribe to different content providers instead of signing up for various apps. In real time, you can stand to receive content from different creators!

Having used Telegram for nearly 2 years, this is my mini-compilation of all the useful Telegram groups and channels which I think you should join! ✈️

🔱 General Topics 🔱

▪️@sgmrt — Train breakdowns, delays, early closures etc. Oh man, how can I not love this especially when trains keep breaking down these days! It’s just amazing how this channel can save me some time and help me to plan ahead.

▪️@kiasufoodies — Deals, promotions and discounts for local food. I personally love this the most because I love to eat! Haha, I feel they feature really good discounts and stuff.

▪️@dateideas — Ideas for your next date. Always not knowing where to go? Well, this is the channel to go to ironically when you are suffering from a loss of ideas. Good for the guys who are always planning outings for their girlfriends.

▪️@sgcabpromos — Promo codes for Grab and CDG. Quite straightforward, for us kiasu Singaporeans who always wish to squeeze that extra mile, LOL.

▪️@sgCareers — A one-stop Career channel for Singaporean, Singapore PR and Foreigners who are looking for great careers in Singapore. Personally, I like how they feature the different jobs, it is always very organized so that it’s clear who to contact. The best thing? It’s free, it’s not some agencies taking a cut but merely an information channel to connect both ends.

▪️@sgInternship — Another awesome Internship channel for students who are exploring cool internships. As a final year student myself, I have not much used for this, because… As you’ve guessed it, I’m graduating soon! But I’ll guess this will prove to be important for my juniors in their search for internships, good luck!

▪️@sgData — A group for Data Enthusiasts to look into Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Convolution Neural Networks, Reinforced Learning and so on. These days I’ve been reading up on AI because who isn’t? Great to chance upon this group for me to socialize with the great experts in the group lololol.

▪️@sgBTO — For all newly wedded couples, still in the jioing phase couples, looking to buy flats to discuss all the upcoming BTO flats! YOLO, better not make that decision anyhow but to do my research first with other fellow BTO-queuers. Good to know how’s the new BTO site like from the other people’s recce.

▪️@Memedef — One of the best Memes Group on NS life! I think it is like super duper funny lololol. The admins are also very friendly. I think its a great resource and community for NSFs and regulars.

▪️@sgTuitions — A channel for listing tuition assignments, many people can use this platform to pitch themselves as tutors or to post their requirements for tutors. Used to use this channel to get tutees but nobody wants to hire me, sad life.

▪️@sgNTU — A group for NTU students to mingle and share about the latest happening in NTU. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS, it’s like 7000+ students and nearly 1300 of them are inside? An absolutely great resource if you’re ever lost in school.

▪️@sgNUS — Another group for NUS students to chit chat about campus life. Similar to @sgNTU, but perhaps better because NUS is better? LOL, just joking!

▪️@sgChats — A general, I think its pretty EPIC, free-for-all type of Singaporean chat! Their lameness is seriously epic, so much crap is being said each day! Really fun to be hearing what my fellow Singaporeans’ days are like.

▪️@MapleStoryMSingapore — A group dedicated for all the Singaporean MapleStory M lovers! I quitted the game quite long ago but it is still fine to be in, lots of activities are still going on inside.

▪️@Hackwagon — A group dedicated for data science courses. This group has commercial interest.

Traffic 🚒 ✈️ 🚀

▪️@sgcustom — Open channel where people update if there are jams along the causeway or JPJ police. Really important for Malaysians and Singaporeans who work across the custom.

Let me know what other channels/groups you think are awesome! I’ll add it here! PM me on Telegram (duh!) @zhenhelim. See ya!",2018-10-09 18:37:20

"I'm not a huge fan of grab but I've only ever had cancellations 1 or 2 times in the 100s of times I've taken grab. Have had a few shitty experiences with late drivers as well but I'd say >98% of the time, the experience has been what I expected (i.e. taxi took me from point A to B) 

On the other hand, my experience with the regular taxis has been far worse. Before the grab/uber days, I've have horrible experiences waiting 30-40 minutes for a cab after a night out, because they just refuse the destination. Or they don't take passengers until the clock hits mid night. Also, now whenever I end up taking normal cabs, I often get these really old uncles who really shouldn't be driving, and some are just plain weird and creepy, making weird noises and keep talking/mumbling to themselves. Once I had an uncle who looked like he was 90 and had hearing aids in both ears. I told him I wanted to go to XYZ and we could take west coast highway. He was like ""I can't drive on highway.....need to go from inside road."" ",2018-05-28 11:03:21

Zombie apocalypse is still a thing? I thought the fad now is dystopian society. ,2017-11-25 12:30:35
"The thing with Zombie infestations is that if a person dies, he will eventually become a zombie unless you damage the head.  So stay indoors isn't an option. And people might not realize that in the beginning.

Here is an escape guide for a zombie apocalypse. There is some basic preparation work involved. 

Join 2-3 sailing clubs in Singapore. it is not expensive.  That will give you access to the various marinas in Singapore

You need to prepare your escape cache, it would have two solar power generator (a small one and a larger one),  a portable RO filtration device, small ham radio, sat phone (with GPS), Tropical First Aid Kit, Kevlar Gloves, Backpack, Swiss Pocket Knife, Thermal Binoculars, High Powered LED Flashlight, Fire Starter, Lightweight Body armor, 4 sets of clothing, RO Filters, golf clubs, fishing line, rope, duct tape, small shovel and seeds. 

Rations for 60 days.Bow and Arrow (legal in Singapore), Homemade Slingshot (illegal)

If it breaks out, where to go? I would pick uninhabited islands in French Polynesia or Pitcairn. The question is how to get there? Fly there if it there isn't an overreaction to the first incidence of zombie infestation. then you don't bring the rations. If people start going crazy, well you have to fight your way to the marina with your 60 days worth of rations.  Why 60 days, it takes about 60 days sailing to get to French Polynesia. You most likely could ration the food for 180 days.

You want to be in a place that is very remote and surrounded by water. The Arctic is nice, but how are you going to survive, that is why I picked the South Pacific.

Now if you don't want to travel that far, you can sail to an uninhabited island in Indonesia among its 17000 islands. But you have to find one with fresh water, by contacting the Directorate of Small Islands (yes there ia government department in Indonesia for that). Although the portable RO device can filter salt water, and one filter can filter thousands of gallons, you would want an island with fresh water.

"Interesting scenario to ponder about. I think for the outcome it depends chiefly on the mobility of the zombies. 

For if the zombies are similar to the walking dead style. Slow and stupid, than i’ll say we will survive in our HDB home atleast till the zombies learnt to climb stairs and open doors. And let the military do their job clearing HDB block by block. The bonus part is, singapore’s firearm are controlled. No fear of other ravaging humans. 
Minimum casualties, will survive.

If its train to busan however, it looks like we are screwed. The zombies are fast and strong. Neighbourhood and market will be devastated immediately and rapidly. Good luck to those staying near MRT stations! Then again, i dont see how the zombies are able to climb the stairs to the 12th storey.
Heavy casualties, with certain neighbourhood virtually wiped. Military are ill prepared, outbreak in camp when reservist are called back for their 4ntm. Remaining survivors bunkered themselves in their 12th storey HDB block and ventured out every night to savage the local NTUC. ",2017-11-25 16:43:02

"Agreed that if we cannot contain the initial outbreak and secure our borders, we are pretty screwed especially if it's like Train to Busan/L4D fast runners kind.

Most survivable scenario: Max Brook's World War Z/Zombie Survival Guide type of zombies, initial outbreak contained with minimal casualties (assume SAF is fast enough to snuff out any outbreak, probably with acceptable collateral damage) Borders secured with dogs sniffing out anyone who try to sneak in (what the Israelis did in WWZ). Coastal areas on high patrol to guard against seaborne zombies. Coastal area HDBs (MP, Woodlands, Tanjong Pagar etc) residents to take up watch duties of coastal lines. 

All HDB staircases be destroyed (including 2nd floor, if kiasi a bit) to isolate units. HDB blocks close enough to one another (especially those new BTOs) to build retractable skywalks to facilitate movement in case an infection got out of hand. Parks converted into gardens for food. Cars probably scrapped to reduce petrol use/spare metal for weapons. Bikes the main mode of transport. MRT broken down long time ago already.

Our troops probably have to work with Msia and Indo counterparts to secure JB/Batam islands to create buffer zones ... assuming our diplomatic ties are that good. Siege conditions to continue until US can get their head together to save our asses.",2017-11-25 17:12:58

There are some things I missed out. With the exception of the rations, bow and arrow and slingshot, the stuff I listed you can take on a plane. Once you get to the South Pacific/Indonesia by plane, you can buy the other stuff when you are there.

I was thinking if you had to fight your way to the marina, and get on a boat.  You would also need a machete, saw, plastic sheeting, hunting knife and some tuber crops (sweet potato, cassava).

If you decide to pick Indonesia, you would head to Eastern Indonesia, because its more isolated, there are a lot of Islands and its sparsely populated. 

Once you get to the island, depending on the month, you could be stuck for six months with very little rainfall. Eastern Indonesia and Polynesia is like that.  That is why you need to find a island with its own water supply.  But if you are forced to settle on an island that depends on rainfall, that is where the Reverse Osmosis (RO) kit is vital, that can distill salt water.

https://www.seataskgroup.com/rainman-portable-watermakers.html

The seeds you would bring would be non-hyrbid corn seed, papaya seeds, onion seeds and breadfruit seeds. I would bring along a bag of sweet potato and yams.The corn, onion, sweet potato and yams can start producing crops within 3-4 months.  The leaves of the sweet potato and yams can serve as vegatables, and you will be able to eat them by the second month

In much of Polynesia and more isolated islands of Eastern Indonesia, there are no mosquitos, that is why I piced these locations.   You don't have to worry about any mosquitos borne diseases like Malaria, Dengue etc.  If you stick around Malaysia/Western parts of Indonesia, you have to bring mosquito nets, and still there is a good chance you are going to get malaria.

You don’t need to lock your doors. Assuming infected people are still capable of rational thought, wouldn’t they just go home? If you’re sick your first thought wouldn’t be to break into someone else’s house and bite them, right?

Just look at how outbreaks are handled, such as that of Ebola. Even during the Black Death people were more interested in taking care of or mourning loved ones than panicking and running around like headless chickens. Unless you really just try to escape the country and leave your parents/relatives behind and focus only on your own survival, instead of notifying them ASAP of the outbreak and making sure everyone is alright.

"**Ophiocordyceps unilateralis**

Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is an entomopathogen, or insect-pathogenising fungus, discovered by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1859, and currently found predominantly in tropical forest ecosystems. O. unilateralis infects ants of the Camponotini tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their mandibles to affix themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains until its eventual death. The process leading to mortality takes 4–10 days, and includes a reproductive stage where fruiting bodies grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores.

"Ugh Grab is terrible. Taxis can reach in 2-3 minutes or generally less than 5 minutes. I have no idea what type of horrible algorithm Grab has, but it consistently pairs me up with drivers 8-9 minutes away. Pair that with traffic jams and I'm frequently having to wait 10-15 minutes for drivers to arrive. Awful when you're rushing to work in the morning. 

We are also short-changed by the points system here. I can get up to 3000 points easily in a weekend trip to KL. But it'll take me a month to save the same amount here. 

Plus the subscriptions that they introduced and are taking away in less than a year. The subscriptions were the only thing I was happy about.",2019-08-08 06:58:39
"Tbh Grab sucks imho. Even since Uber days, I feel they are overpriced af. They claim to reward customers based on loyalty programs but if you think about it, you're only getting back like $5 after don't know how many trips. So the total incentives that you're getting is probably -10cents for each trip if you divide it up altogether.

Plus the surge prices are absurd! And due to this, there are a lot of times where if you choose to hail a normal cab via the Grab app or on call, you couldn't find any car at all. Because all of them are waiting for customers to book Justgrab -.-

And do you remember the first month after Uber cease their services in Singapore? Prices went ridiculously high despite non-surge pricing. Example of a company that's 100% shameless.

So when Gojek came out, I was super duper happy as I feel that their prices are much better. Plus sometimes if you book 1-3 rides in the same week, you will enjoy 50% off (up to a few dollars) during the weekends or your subsequent rides.

I really don't get why people like Grab so much. Their deals are barely worth it and I felt that their absurd surge multipliers made the whole ride hailing and cab industry far more worst. Because back then if you book a cab via phone call, you could still get a cab. But Grab has only made drivers much more choosy.

I'm speaking from a customer POV. Perhaps it's genuinely the best to be employed under Grab as a driver, but from a customer's perspective, they suck.",2019-08-08 00:01:46
"I think your pick-up point and destination plays a part.

I live in the north and travel to work in the south. Grab home almost every day. Grab's prices are always the best for me. Even if it surges to 30 bucks (usual is 19), Comfort and Gojek is still more expensive. Only when it surges to 40 bucks is Comfort cheaper. Even then I wait out the surge and it usually goes back to normal after 15-20 mins. Plus I buy the subscription that gives me twenty $10 vouchers per month, so I save about 5 bucks each trip.

But when it comes to shorter distances, Gojek is cheaper.",2019-08-08 11:02:10
"Grab is horrible. And because of PHVs, there are lesser flaggable taxis on the roads, which means we are sometimes forced to pay Grab's ridiculous prices",2019-08-08 11:20:39
"I find that it’s all about timing. I just learn to avoid the peak hours and grab can sometimes actually be cheaper than go jek. There’s also the reliability factor. There are simply more Grab drivers available in my area than go jek. 

For grab food, I find I rarely use the free delivery vouchers, but that’s mainly because they keep flooding me with other promotion vouchers. For instance, the $8 / month promotion (which combines free delivery with $4 grab discounts) gives me a $5 and $10 voucher each month. Then every now and then, I also get a 35% voucher snuck into my inbox as well. By and large, it’s still cheaper for me to order grabfood compared to other competing services or walking out to get dinner, although their food selection is a little worse.",2019-08-08 05:28:34

You can also consider downloading the comfortdelgro app. I've experienced multiple times whereby comfortdelgro offered a cheaper rate than grab and gojek.,2019-08-08 09:51:39

Also, wasn't it Uber who first introduced surge pricing?",2019-08-08 10:38:59

"Depends; personally 7/10 times, Gojek is cheaper for me. I compare Grab and Gojek prices plus Tada from time to time, and found that Grab is more expensive even in normal times. 

The funny thing though, Grab in Malaysia is cheap af. I mean even basing on distance, the numerical values are still a lot cheaper. Example would be that for the same distance, MY would take around 7 RM while SG already takes 12 SGD. See what I mean?

Yeah but Uber's surge comes and go almost immediately, while Grab hangs over that state for more than 20-30mins at times.",2019-08-08 11:02:31

"how come you all never hear of this.........covered by online media last time. 

anyway here is some points, might wanna read the whole thing or other reports

> Reporters say they are eager to produce more investigative and critical reporting, but they are **stifled by editors who have been groomed to tow the line.**

> There is a growing disconnect between ST's reporters and its editors, with the reporters wanting to do more investigative and critical stories than the editors will allow.  

> Chua lamented that the **ST editors have all been groomed as pro-government supporters and are careful to ensure that reporting of local events adheres closely to the official line.**  

> Chua said that unless one of the editors is a ""Trojan Horse,"" someone that for years has successfully concealed any non pro-government leanings, **none of them has the courage to 
 publish any stories critical of the government.** 

> The **government exerts significant pressure on ST editors to ensure that published articles follow the government's line,** Chua said.  In the past, the editors had to contend only with the opinions of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew (now Minister Mentor) and former Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong (now Senior Minister).  However, a younger generation of government ministers is now vying for future leadership positions and one way for them to burnish their credentials with the old guard is to show they can be tough with the media, Chua said.  As a result, several current ministers and second ministers (Chua did not say which ones) routinely call ST editors to ensure that media coverage of an issue comes out the way they want it.  While Chua admitted that he knew of no editors who had been fired or otherwise punished for printing articles critical of the government, he said that is because **all of the them have been vetted to ensure their pro-government leanings.** 

> 8. (C) Lynn Lee (strictly protect), a reporter for ST, confirmed the disconnect between editors and reporters.  Lee highlighted the internal debate over the amount of coverage that the paper would dedicate to opposition icon J.B. Jeyaretnam (JBJ) following his death in September 2008.  **Lee said that while the editors agreed with reporters' demand for extensive coverage of JBJ political career and funeral (ref B), they rejected reporters' suggestions to limit the amount of coverage devoted to (relatively long) eulogies provided by Singapore's leaders.  The leaders' statements took up a significant portion of the allotted space, Lee lamented.**

"Welcome to Singapore! 

I'm guessing there might be some debates over 'which one is better' later, so I'm just gonna chip in my 2 cents first. Spending 3 days in Singapore while working full-time doesn't sound long enough to me, so you have a fairly tight schedule to work around, and it heavily depends on where your office is and where you are staying for these 3 days. Singapore is a city-state but it still takes some time to travel, and people are willing to travel across the island and queue for good food here. Considering accessibility, my personal recommendations would be:

**Chicken Rice**: Tian Tian & Ah Tai @ Maxwell Food Centre, Sin Kee @ Holland Village, Ming Kee @ Bishan, Wee Nam Kee and Boon Tong Kee (with a few outlets around the island) are all not bad. It's a very down to earth dish after all so I'm happy with many hawkers.

**Laksa**: Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa @ Hong Lim Complex, Katong Laksa @ 1 Telok Kurau near Eunos, The Original Katong Laksa @ Roxy Square, Geylang Laksa near Sims Vista Market. I used to love 328 Katong Laksa @ Queensway Shopping Centre as a student but their quality isn't as good as what I could recall. Laksa is a tricky one as you might need to travel out of town a bit to get a super nice bowl, but many noodle shop serves this too if you're not picky. 

**Char Kway Teow**: 786 Char Kway Teow and Day Night Fried Kway Teow, both near Redhill. Meng Kee near Tiong Bahru is pretty good too and they serve decent fried radish cake too. My taste buds ain't super good while handly my Kway Teow, so many I've tried so far are pretty decent.

**Nasi Lemak**: Ponggol Nasi Lemak @ Jalan Besar, Xiang Xiang Nasi Lemak @ Tanjong Pagar Plaza, Mount Faber Nasi Lemak along Kreta Ayer. I don't have a strong preference for this personally either. The first one is well liked by my friends but I find it a bit overrated. The latter two are all near the city centre and hence fairly accessible. 

**Claypot Rice**: Lian He Ben Ji and Zhao Ji near Chinatown, Geylang Claypot Rice near Kampong Glam. Usually it takes a while for your order to come, and those stores are closer to the city centre, hence a lot more convenient if you'd like to try.",2019-05-29 06:36:49

If you can don't use bicycle deliver cause it's super tiring and you usually have to travel 1-2km with a heavy box weighing you down. And don't forget about upslope and barriers which just a pain tbh. But if u have escooter should be piece of cake ah. back then I deliver using bicycle after seven orders I started regretting hahahaha. 

Have talked to friends who worked with deliveroo and foodpanda seems like they almost similar system such as ranking or tiers. If I'm not wrong you'll start with a certain rank and it will increase after you done a certain amount of deliveries. then the higher ur rank the higher your pay ah also higher rank have first priority to book slots to work. Deliveroo you will select the location and time but I don't know about foodpanda or grab food if you location is fixed but the selling point of deliver boy is that you have flexible hours which is convineint for students 

pay wise basic ah the more you send the more you get sometimes peak hour amount you get per delivery can double

2) marina bay orchard road sentosa 
3) laksa chicken rice char kway teow fish ball mee chilli crab black pepper crab ",2018-06-13 12:50:18
"1) Taxi. Not sure where you're from, but compared to Central\-Europe and the USA, our taxi\-rates are pretty competitively\-priced.

Transport wise, go get an EZ\-Link card ASAP for use in the MRTs(public subway) and buses. I believe there is a version for Tourists. You will save an incredible amount using the card instead of raw cash buying each ticket separately.

\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-

2a) Changi Airport's transit area, no seriously, if this is your first time in Changi Airport, you will really want to explore what the world considers as the best airport in the world. Maybe not during your arrival due to luggage collection, but do seriously consider going in early before your departure just to wander around the transit area.

2b) This one is more of a tourist trap, but IT IS designed for tourists, and if it is your first time in Singapore, Marina Bay's Gardens by the Bay should be a nice experience for you. You can explore the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome during the day, and check out the musical treelights at the Supertree Grove at night.

Do note that they have maintenance days. Check out the website and plan accordingly.

[http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en.html](http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en.html)

For food, Satay by the Bay is a relatively decent place to check out the different types of food available in Singapore. Avoid the mini\-food\-stalls, they will cut your throat with their prices (easily 2\-3 times more expensive than the norm).

2c) I considered saying Sentosa, but I think I shilled enough for STB already. Instead I will recommend the Turtle Museum at Chinese Gardens.

[http://www.turtle\-tortoise.com/](http://www.turtle-tortoise.com/)

The Chinese Gardens is also adjacent to the Japanese Gardens, both of which are located within Jurong Lake. This area is a much more quiet side of Singapore, with relatively few tourists. Quite popular with wedding photographers though, due to the scenic surroundings.

\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-

3) If you really want to eat what the locals usually eat, go for hawker centres. Bear in mind that they are outdoor areas in confined spaces, so it can get heaty if you are not used to the heat and humidity.

Recommended Hawker Centres would be Bedok Hawker Centre (next to the Bedok MRT), Changi Village Hawker Centre (will need to take a bus to here, and it's next to the beach), Lau Pa Sat (night only, at the roadside).

If you cannot stand the heat, and are dying to eat in air\-conditioned comfort, then Food Courts would be your next best bet. For tourists, the ""Food Republic"" chain of Food Courts will be a safe bet to dine in. About 50&#37; pricier than Hawker Centres, but with a good standard of food quality.

Koufu is also an okay Food Court for tourists. About 25&#37; pricier than Hawker Centres.

Avoid Foodfare Food Courts... only eat there as a last resort if the alternative is starvation. You will get a terrible impression about local food if you go there.

Avoid Rasapura Masters in Marina Bay Sands. Terrible quality at terrible mark\-ups.",2018-06-13 15:27:14

"By ""rest of the world gets nuked"", I assume it's a Global Thermo Nuclear War with the superpowers involved. If it's between USA and Russia, NATO allies will stick together and the battlefront will most definitely be the European side. 

What Singapore has to worry about it is China. In the Global fracas, you can bet China will push its expansionist agenda and encroach upon all disputed territories: South China Sea, Tibet, bits of India.

The Philippines and Japan have US bases, but if the USA is occupied with the European front, it may be hard to focus on the East. China may not be able to steamroller the Far East, but it can expand significantly with little resistance. Singapore may not be caught in this. The South East Asian countries probably not have much of an army to fight the Chinese, but enough to stem expansion.

As such, Singapore will be on high alert, but will have to lay low and remind the warring nations of their diplomatic ties. This is paramount to Singapore's survival. It can't afford to take sides.

What I feel is, Singapore will be even more crowded. It's a prominent port, a busy airport, and it's a gateway to Oceania. You can bet that Asian people with means will flee to Australia, and this means tons of seafaring and airfaring traffic. All going through Singapore. War-time Singapore can be profitable in the short term, but the influx or refugees, migrants and transients, and the volatile political scenario will give rise to high crime and rampant corruption. Not to mention an ample supply of fleeing migrants who will be willing to do anything to survive and pay for their passage to Australia. Unscrupulous folks will take advantage of this, and make money out of it. This behavior - now that it's profitable in war time - will be encouraged, and Singaporean society as a calm, collected and law-abiding one will be gone.

On the other side of the coin, xenophobia will be at an all time high. Outside of the refugees and the in-betweeners clogging up space and using up resources, if the US Navy gets permission to be docked in Singapore (to check China), it's going to be a mini Okinawa, with lots of US Marines going nuts in town. Brothels will flourish, casinos will pop up everywhere, and violence galore. Locals are going to hate Americans, and the Singapore government will have to do their best to assuage the local's concerns, citing the need for a watchdog in their backyard.

This resentment among locals could turn them into double agents for China, and Singapore is fertile ground for spy games, both by Chinese and US agents. Under the veneer of booming trade and neutrality in the war, Singapore will be the playground for international espionage.

**EDIT: More Thoughts on the Matter**

Since this is a Global Thermo Nuclear War, there will be fallout, radiation poisoning and affected people wanting to get out of the war zones they're in. There will be huge public outcry over letting affected refugees in, over fears of transmitting radiation. Depending on how big the crowd is, Singapore will close its doors to countries where the bombs have fallen. For example, South Korea.

Why South Korea? Watching the global drama unfold, North Korea may get excited and try to imitate China. Its first target will of course be South Korea. Cue mass exodus from S.Korea. Most of them will go to Japan, but the richer ones will try to fly as far away as they can, and Singapore is one stop away from the vast continent of Australia.

The situation in South Asia too could deterioriate. India and Pakistan, both nuclear countries, have long been at loggerheads with each other and who knows, GTNW could heighten tensions and war between the two. If bombs fall on either, cue mass exodus of Indians/Pakistanis, towards Australia. Transit Singapore.

I do not not know yet where Australia will be in all of this. As long-standing supporters of The West, they will hold their fort and provide military support to the US and Europe, but they will also curb immigration bigly. Legal or otherwise. Too many damn people will be trying to get into Australia, and xenophobia becomes even more virulent. The White Australia policy may rear its ugly head again.

Africa for the most part will be unaffected, and could be a safe haven for refugees. But in many African countries, China already has tight trade relations in exchange for infrastructural support provided, so those African countries will side with China. This could affect refugee movement.",2016-12-20 16:00:06

"Assuming we don't get wiped out in the fray or in the fallout:

1. We have zero natural resources. Zero. No food no water. No infrastructure in place to start stealing from the other wiped out countries either. If Malaysia and our neighboring countries that supply us with those essentials go down, we're looking at full blown starvation and death.

2. As a result of 1, people aware of this fact (basically everyone) will lose their shit. We as a country are not culturally equipped AT ALL to deal with crisis, despite all our attempts to harden up for the possibility. It's just not going to happen when everyone's sitting comfortably at home, so in the even of such crises, Singaporeans will most definitely devolve into rioters, looters and whatnot.

3. As a result of 2, the SPF, SCDF and SAF will most surely crumble because loyalty and patriotism are scarce even among the regulars, and the NS:Regular ratio is incredibly wide. NSFs/NSmen wouldn't give too much of a shit about enforcing any kind of law when they're in the exact predicament as everyone else. Defections will be commonplace to say the least, and they will be no better than the rest of the populace.

Assuming we don't even physically experience any of the effect, Singapore will struggle to survive beyond a few weeks.

I will disagree with this. As a country with only 5.5 million people, zero natural resources and nothing but its strategic importance as a harbor and its trading potential, Singapore is not high on anyone's list.

[GFP rates Singapore's military strength at 64th, of 126 countries.](http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp) For context, Malaysia ranks 34th, and Indonesia at 14th. We hear a lot about the superior training and the high tech weaponry, but the other two countries outnumber Singapore's core force manifold. And have the resources to sustain a longer period of warfare or defence.

Singapore can hold its own and can deter neighbors from any funny business during peace time, but when the chips are down (like in a nuclear war), the island will be bulldozed, should it get in the way of another country's expansionist ambitions. Trading and diplomacy are Singapore's only reliable weapons for the long haul.",2016-12-20 20:56:12

"First of all, there is a reason why the United States were the first and only power to use nukes deliberately. 

However, if the unthinkable happened and a low-intensity conflict suddenly went hot and became ""nuclear""... well...

Unless strategic doctrine has altered dramatically from what it was during the Cold War, Singapore would not even be a target for a nuke since the majority of the nuclear powers' arsenal would be expended into striking each other. Why bother striking a city state in South East Asia when your nukes can be used to strike at the important strategic areas of your enemies directly? 

The United States and its allies in Europe, together with the most probable antagonists in the form of Russia and China will certainly be crippled with major cities and strategic targets all taken out. Even in the initial provocation they were not involved, India and Pakistan will probably have attacked each other as well. The Korean peninsula will most likely be gone as well if rumours of North Korea having dirty nukes are true. Japan, as the home base for alot of U.S naval assets, would also be targeted and decimated. 

Israel does not advertise it but most believe they are nuclear capable. So, there goes the Middle East if they were responding in kind to a chemical or biological attack. 

Depending on the post thermonuclear phase, we will most likely become a target for the various nations surrounding us unless we can convince them otherwise that the sane way moving forward will be to form an alliance to tough out the inevitably harsh years that follow. ",2016-12-20 18:01:35

"> Plus cars are often shielded, and don't have long enough antennas to convey the power surge, that's why they tell you to hide in cars during a lightning storm.

They tell you to hide in cars during a lightning storm because of the skin effect.  High voltages travel along the surface of the metal, so you're safe touching the inside of it.  This is a separate and different effect to the one that would blow up electronics using EMP.  I've engineered things inside metal enclosures that get fried by surges caused by lightning, it's not enough protection if an antenna of any kind is going out of the enclosure - that basically makes it not a faraday cage anymore.  And no, you can't just easily find another ECU, because even disconnected modules will be affected and computers will usually be required to get them talking to a new car.

> Also, small devices like wristwatches and smartphones can easily survive HEMP blasts because their size is too small to conduct the surge.

Not true.  Their antennas will pick up and channel the surge right into the core of their electronics.

> The underlying connections that make up the internet, would largely survive. It would only appear dead because the end point servers that host content would be knocked out. But the trunk cables that carry the majority of data worldwide are largely heavily shielded against EMP and they'd continue to operate as soon as we have new machines built and reconnected to the internet and hosting stuff again.

The trunk cables are not EMP shielded, they're just made of glass fiber, which doesn't pass any electrical pulses.  Replacing the electronics is non-trivial and the destruction of major powers will make that nearly impossible.  

>By the time EMP would seriously be knocking out every single remotely electronic object made, we'd have blown ourselves sky high to the point there's no atmosphere to speak of.

That's not true either.  You can detonate a nuke in space and affect huge areas using the EMP blast without even causing any other damage.

There is a thing called Himalayas. Granted that infantry fighting can take place but only at battalion/regimental level as evidentiary from Kargil war.

Neither Chinese will push their soldiers over ranges which are excess of 24,000 feet neither will us Indians

Tibet is a bad place to take off from due to its high altitude geography which limits the payload on the fighters and bombers whereas Indians can take off from the nearby sea level cities with full payload

The mountain passes are unpassable in the winters because temps fall to -70

Indian navy could choke off the strait to strangle all Chinese shipping especially their oil.

All in all any hostilities between india and china would likely see the end of the world.

Pakistanis will keep sending terrorists through the unpolicable region of kahsmie with the help of the ISI AND PAK army. Thats never going to end, we could it in a week but that would mean mobilising a million troops in less than 2 days and leading with armoured thrusts across Pakistani Punjab and Sindh. 
Just like the American Shock and Awe in Iraq

But all of this is stupid, no leadership is that stupid
Hence I said China won't dare step in India because we have the power to completely wreak havoc in tibet.

Pakistanis can only send a few hundred fighters every year, so what? we'll mobilise a few thousand more troops.

Our elections had us mobilise 1 million plus central armed police troops.

Then you propose high speed rail throughout Asia. That completely removes all the geographical barriers and makes it very easy for China to send huge columns of tanks through a tunnel under the Himalayas which they built. Suddenly the geographical barriers are taken down and there is huge tension again.  
Furthermore, Pak's nuclear arsenal is not exactly in safe hands. Fine, COAS/ISI leadership may not want to nuke India, but some parts of ISI are crazy enough to try that, and if they get their hands on the Pak nuclear arsenal, that would lead to a very dangerous situation.

"Are you drawing a distinction between what you term the 'new economy' and what others call the 'gig economy'?


Gig economy would entail people utilising spare resources that they own (time, vehicles, machinery, real estate etc.) to provide services for others. When they first sprung up years ago, they were thought to be basically side hussles that could be a good source of supplementary income. The whole notion was that you could be your own boss in the gig economy. What has developed in the intervening years is that startups have identified potential gaps in the service industry and filled them using software and contract labour.


In a way, by labeling the workers as contractors, these startups can reduce their hiring costs (since healthcare and severance packages are not offered) whilst remaining able to tap into a huge workforce whenever the need arises. As long as the software for matching consumer and product remains functional, these startups are able to entrench themselves in an increasingly unassailable position as the faciliator or middleman of the transaction. To the start ups, workers are indistinguishable from one another and as such easily dispensible. From this perspective, most workers in the gig economy are unlikely to be better off than traditional full-time workers.

If you try and do it as a ""hobby"" job where you go out when it suits you (e.g. drop the kids off at school/husband off at work and then drive during the middle of the day) you probably won't break even on it. 

I doubt the top end numbers will drop down - there will always be a group of people willing to get out there and work the longer hours.

"Only it doesn't quite work as you might expect it to in some instances. I have a DBS card with NETS FlashPay -- you can use it on the train, etc, but the funds come out of the FlashPay ""wallet"". It doesn't come directly out of your account - this is a key difference: NETS is not NETS FlashPay. To link your bank account and the FlashPay wallet, you need to set up an automatic direct debit.

But as a Mastercard DBS debit card, you cannot set up automatic top up of FlashPay. Apparently you can only do it for VISA. 

But you can top up your card at a station GTM... Which leads to this very confusing situation:

1. Place DBS card on reader
2. Make your selection to top up card while NOT removing your card.
3. Select NETS.
4. Be told to insert your NETS card, only you CAN'T remove your card.
5. Give up, go to the ATM and using DBS card withdraw from the ATM to put into GTM.
6. Miss your train.

I'm more amused than annoyed. I just went and bought an EZLINK card in the end.",2015-10-28 14:54:04

You can turn your phone into the actual transmitter if you have NFC sim. I think all telcos offer it. ",2015-10-28 13:29:32

"I entertain and bring guests (mainly caucasians) around to eat pretty often. But something that my father said which has stuck with me is this: 

""These guys are from overseas who have no real experience with the local delicacies. They probably won't know a good chicken rice to a great chicken rice, etc etc. So either bring them to where you want to go, or go to a place where it is the most convenient/tourist friendly."" 

He's absolutely right. Most guests won't even know a great chicken rice at all. Mainly because, at their home country, chicken rice is not readily available. And even if it is, it will NOT be as good as the chicken rice at the HDB around the corner. The regular HDB around the corner. 

So the solution? I bring them to Boon Tong Kee on Balestier. Why? Because it is decent chicken rice (at least IMO), air-conditioned, a variety of dishes, and (the most important) its clean (for the guests). 

You may scoff at the idea, but our taste buds and theirs are very different. So unless they have spent a considerable amount of time in Asia. They wouldn't know the different between the chicken rice at the HDB, the chicken rice at golden mile tower, the chicken rice at boon tong kee, or the chicken rice at maxwell. 

Now, substitute chicken rice for any other delicacies along the way. ",2014-02-10 12:50:40
