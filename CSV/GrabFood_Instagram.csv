I ordered in for lunch and took about 40 minutes to reach me.It’s great that they packed the soup separately, but might have to request for pork lard on the app because they don’t include by default. Taste wise, the noodles were still springy and chewy.",2020-09-09,04:39:30

24,futuristfergo,"KEEPING THE DREAMS ALIVE - MY COVID 19 JOURNEYWhy do @grabfoodsg ? And how have your live change?The earnings may not be much, but it serves as my passive income. Before the start of every week, I will calculate the possible or expected total expenditure amount. I will then work hard to meet the targeted amount. For example, if I know that I’m going to have a meeting at @starbuckssg , and I will probably be spending, $30. I will do my delivery rides between classes or after classes to obtain the amount.However hard the circumstances are, I will never give up on my responsibilities and my dreams. I will keep my dreams alive.Aren’t you ashamed? There is a possibility that you will meet your clients or colleagues?Certainly, the possibility of meeting any of them is there. But personally, there is nothing to be ashamed of.Have you ever seen, the physically challenged individuals who are working? Or even the elderlies?I am more ashamed if I don’t do anything to better myself or my situation given that I am able bodied and capable.I’ve never been ashamed doing any kind of jobs as long as I know that whatever im doing is permissible in the eye of the nation’s law and from the perspective of my religion. Like many of us, I come from a family which encountered many hardships yet we continue to strive for excellence.When I was younger, my brother and I, we used to buy cartons of can drinks from @shengsiongsupermarket_official and put them in Styrofoam boxes filled with ice made from home. We then tie the boxes on to the additional passenger seats on our bicycles. We will cycle to hard to reach areas at East Coast Park, basketball courts and street soccer courts to sell them. Besides that, we also gave tuitions and worked as hotel dishwasher at Grand Hyatt. We paid for our A-level examination fees and we never ask from our parents for our school pocket money.To all of you out there if you’re contemplating, there’s nothing to be ashamed of.#resilienteconomy #startuplife #socialtechnopreneur #student #grabfoodsg #shengsiongsupermarket",2020-10-31,08:09:29

While waiting for the outcome of his appeal, he works part time as Grabfood deliveryman to support himself and his family.“Happiness to me is to be with my family. I have always enjoy doing stuff with my family.My current struggle in life is I am addicted to mobile gaming (Call of duty) and I spend about $100-$200 on mobile game every month. I am trying to cut down on my spending but finding hard to do so.My dream is to open an automobile maintenance workshop with a friend in the future. Something that my friends do not know is that I always feel inferior when I am with them. They are always smarter and had accomplished more things than me.My little moment is gaming.

146,ray_yee,"Continues ... @lloydsinnAnother disappointment: I indicated that I would like to have a queen size bed during my booking. My bed looked like one but I realized it was joined together from 2 single beds. Come on! This is not a budget hotel! With the premium price that I have paid, I could not even get a decent queen size bed? To add salt to the wounds, during check-in, the staff at the concierge reiterated my request during the check in. If she would tell me that the bed I would be getting were 2 joined-single beds, at least my heart was prepared. The whole experience really spoilt my dream #staycationsgTalking about #customercentricity and #transparency these days... #lloydsinnsingapore has much to learn.Well I was determined not to be spoilt by these experiences. So I explored around the area for eateries 🍲 🍱 🥘.Indeed one is spoilt with choices - from local coffee shops to restaurants, a wide selection! Whether it’s comfort food from Killiney Kopitiam, or Hong Kong Tim Sum by So Good Char Chang Ting, there will definitely one that will suit you. Other choices will be like Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Western etc. Look out for my food reviews to some of these places I have visited next week.Lloyd’s Inn comes with a simple breakfast set, in collaboration with ABC, Artisan Boulangerie Co. as they don’t have a kitchen or restaurant in the hotel. They do have an outdoor seating areas where you can #grabfoodsg and enjoy the alfresco dining.Overall, a very unique experience. Would I be back again? Hmmmf, I would think twice with the same amount for a hotel that know how to appreciate their guests.Rate: 3/5Price: $$$........#ryphotographytravel #raymondyeehotelreview #hotelreview #sghotelreview #hotelbloggers #travelblog #travelsg #raymondyeetravel #singaporehotel #honestreview #lloydsinn",2021-03-17,23:54:14

We have encountered a large number of no shows or last minute cancelations by guests over the last several weeks. As you might be aware, we are a limited seating restaurant and every loss of business without sufficient time to cover puts a strain on our finances and resources. This card authorization that you're being requested to process is only in the event a reservation is canceled with less than 3 days notice or if the guest doesn't show for their reservation at all. No amount is charged to a guest's card if they dine as planned. Thanks for your understanding. Do let us know if you have any other queries or need clarification on anything",2021-03-21,11:40:55

1363,rachjiakpng,"📍 Ng Kuan Pan Mee [#rjpkovan]had an odd craving for dry ban mian and decided to GrabFood @ngkuanchillipanmee. I’ve had a few bites of their ban mian from my dining companion the last time I was at their Upper Serangoon kopitiam, but never had it on my own. now time for a full-fledged review!🌶 𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐛𝐚𝐧 𝐦𝐢𝐚𝐧 (𝐝𝐫𝐲) [$9]at an eyebrow-raising $9 you get their signature spicy dry ban mian, along with a small (and by small I really mean small—the pictured stack of chicken is actually 2 servings that I plated together) portion of their well-seasoned chicken that’s been fried to a nice, just-sinful-enough crisp. despite being a little less crispy than I imagine it would be if I’d dined in, the chicken still retained a relatively firm crunch and was tasty enough for me to overlook the fact that it wasn’t hot off the fryer.the ban mian was another story. I’d opted for mee hoon kueh and was sorry to realise how badly they clumped together when I tried to mix everything up. it was virtually impossible to separate each piece. I’d resigned myself to eating them as one clump, making the whole dish taste more like a spicy-savoury mua chee of sorts. 🤠as many before me have pointed out, the chilli does have a pretty strong kick, but that’s not something I minded as someone who appreciates some spice (and hasn’t tried enough chilli ban mian to comment further 😅). what I didn’t really fancy was the oiliness of the whole affair, thanks to the copious amount of chilli provided in proportion to the noodles. it got a bit jelat for me at the end, leaving an unpleasant taste of excess oil in the mouth.TLDR: worth a try? maybe once, and maybe for the fried chicken. not so much for their namesake ban mian, which is honestly pretty good in terms of texture (if you dine in) and finishing touches (I loved the garlic crisps), but can get a bit too overbearing in terms of taste.",2021-03-13,10:13:51

It's really heart warming to know that the uncle on the far right sharing with his children (we think) on why this is called Kek Ai Tiam in the olden days. ""Kek Ai"" is actually a Hokkien word used by the Chinese living in the Kampong Village, referring it as a provision shop. It is actually derived from the Malay word ""Kedai"" which means ""shop"". So when the Chinese heard from their Malay neighbours calling it Kedai, the Chinese community had come out with their own version of calling it ""Kekai"".

1774,botak.motor.tiam,"A Senior Foodpanda rider came in with complains of loud rattling noise and lost of power when he go above 80km/hr.So we did our usual checks only to discover that his CVT rollers are beyond normal wear and tear😂What amazed us is that his mileage is only 10,000km from his previous CVT Service.After a through tear down to check why his bike can't go over 80km/hr, we found out that his fuel filter is filthy and clogged as well, which is not surprising, when his bike clocked over 100,000km while doing Food Delivery jobs.We then checked his fuel pump, changed his fuel filter, refreshed his whole CVT with a new Pulley, Clutch and a Full CVT servicing package promo.Followed by a good wash, Owner told us that his bike felt like almost brand new 🤣Do check out our current promos that is ongoing for all riders, especially delivery heros who delivered food during these hard times.#sgbikes #sginstabikes #sgmotors #singaporebikes #sgriders #sglocal #sgbikers #sgbikerslife #sgbikelife #singapore #singaporebikers #sglocalbusiness #aeroxsg #y15zrsg #ysukusg #sniper150 #xmaxsg #nmaxsg #xmaxnation #pcxsingapore #hondawavesg #sgpromo #sgpromos #sgpromotion #grabfoodsg #deliveroosg #foodpandasg #hondawavesg #deliveryherosg #deliverysg #deliveryrider",2021-03-11,21:23:52

1788,leanbento,"Multiple location delivery islandwide! 🚚💨.We know by now that food deliveries are costly, especially for freshly prepared food which are time-sensitive and food safety is priority. Delivery fees could equal, or cost more than the price of the food itself. 🥵.Then, there are situations when food deliveries were wrongfully cancelled or failed to show up without a respectful reason, just when you were so hangrily looking forward to it. 😥.Enjoy reliable and tasty islandwide meal deliveries to not only one, but to multiple locations at lowered flat fees. The ordering process made simple, and responsive. Bye bye tedious days of “one-order-to-one-location”. 🥳.What’s better, is the humanised telephone and email support you can receive. After all, who wouldn’t prefer meaningful advice over a voice-recorded message or worse, an “AI help desk” that takes you on a merry-go-round. Bye bye frustration. 🤩.From 6 locations to more than 500 locations, we’ve fulfilled them all. Hop on the leanbento.com bandwagon to deliver tasty meals to your colleagues and friends!🎖🍱💕.Let us say “Hi!” to you at 67504504 and order@leanbento.com for all your enquiries about our islandwide pre-orders, multiple location deliveries, and corporate/gym orders.💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♂️______Islandwide delivery 🚚🍱💨#leanbento #foodpandasg #grabfoodsg #deliveroosg #lazadasg #halalcertified #halalsg #wherewhatwow #foodsg #instafood_sg #sgfood #sgvegetarian #sgvegan #sgsme #stayhomemakansg #sgmakan #sgbrand #sgbrands #enterprisesg #asmesg #supportlocal #sgunited #ramadan #ramadan2021 #hariraya2021",2021-03-10,14:53:16
