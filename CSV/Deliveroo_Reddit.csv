doc_naf,"I have to say, all three have sucked at various points in time. 

Deliveroo has, more than once, not delivered orders because they could not find riders. They just kept changing the estimated arrival time until we cancelled (I’m talking teatime stuff for office ordered at 2pm that hasn’t arrived after 4pm and they still have no rider).

Foodpanda makes it insanely difficult to find the help chat, and then they go in these logical loops and keep doing stupid shit. Shit so stupid i was convinced the guy on the other side was a bot. And every time we disconnected because my screen locked while waiting for a reply, I got a new dumbass and had to repeat myself over and over. I usually only get a refund after I’ve wasted more than an hour. (Eg Foodpanda placed an order at a restaurant that was closed and replaced by a totally different restaurant, this was discovered by my rider who went to pick up the order and realised there was no such shop, and the customer service guy assured me my order would be delivered, called the rider and told him to go back, and called the ex employee of the restaurant and told him to prepare the order. When the rider called me back again I had to repeat my story. Took nearly 2 hours on the phone to get my $30 back). But they are often cheaper than grab.

Grab was only good because they had vouchers that drove down the cost of delivery. Once the vouchers are gone probably won’t use it except for self pickup.",2020-11-30 19:52:28,10,,,/r/singapore/comments/k3qqvp/customer_service_deliveroo_vs_foodpanda_vs_grab/

Second time: we ordered at 10am and they delivered at 1pm, again getting the order partially wrong. Third time was the same. We then abandoned them completely.

archerfrase,"I have an unpleasant experience with Grabfood before but I felt that we were partly at fault so I did not pursue any further. But posting here because I'm curious to know if anyone has any 2 cents on whether Grab should be refunding us in our case.
Basically I helped my aunt order food via her Grab app for about 3 pax so it is a considerable amount of food. Address input was not fully complete (no unit number) and because my aunt is new to this whole food ordering thing she did not monitor her phone at all after we placed the order. Delivery man called twice, she did not hear her phone to pick it up. Around 10min passed before we realised and by then the whole transaction had been cancelled from Grab's end and there was no way we could call the delivery man back. Food did not arrive at all and Grab refused to give us refund. Thoughts? Should they have done so out of goodwill? Afterall we made payment for food that we did not receive at all. But on the other hand it is because we did not provide the full address.",2020-12-01 19:19:39,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/k3qqvp/customer_service_deliveroo_vs_foodpanda_vs_grab/

Don't think mine was a glitch but a mistake on the customer's end.

I went through the standard motion, wait 5-10 min and disposed of the food.

Another Grab support staff did call me when I was already at location A and said the customer called and asked if I could return the food back to the restaurant while Grab re-assigns the delivery to a motorcyclist. 

Funny how they didn't try to resolve that when I was still at the restaurant and on the line with Grab support. They didn't want to compensate me for making another trip back so yea I rejected it.

wildflowersgrow,"Imagine you're Grab. FoodPanda and Deliveroo has been around for years but now you want a slice of the food delivery pie. 

So you do what you did with private hire services back when Uber was around. You cut crazy ass deals to the public in order to gain market share. Remember it began with an $8 a month subscription plan (30 deliveries, free $5 & $10 voucher and no minimum order!).

I've worked as a delivery rider before so I can tell you we can about $6 - $8 per drop (this can go even higher in certain places in town). 

And so imagine if you ordered a $10 meal. 30% goes to Grab for its fees - that's $3. But on top of that, Grab has to pay $6 - $8 to the rider who delivered your food to you. Now that's negative $3 - $5. Add in the support staff, the data scientists that are responsible for the algorithms and other staff at Grab's HQ, you can imagine that subscription plan is really not a sustainable one.

It was never meant to be around forever. It's only goal was to gain market share and monopolise the food delivery market in terms of both customers and riders (so many people have gone over from Panda/Kangaroo).

And the COVID-19 crisis was just a catalyst. Higher demand and people willing to pay extra fees. 

No, I do not work for Grab and i'm not some Grab-fanatic. 

In fact, while as a food delivery rider in the past (for Panda) i benefitted from the price wars, I thought it was really stupid delivering $6.50 foods when I was getting $8 for it.

Just thought even as a consumer, if we aspire to be savvy, we have to look both sides of the picture, not just ours.

ngrenjie,"Unpopular opinion - I think what they are doing is necessary.

The simple reality is that for all their size, none of them are profitable because their costs scale in line with the number of customers they service. This isn’t like Google or telcos where their costs are fixed in nature (ie: server / infrastructure costs), and marginal cost of serving each additional user is close to zero. 

With food delivery companies, they have no such benefit. Each additional order means they need to assign an extra rider to bring that food to your doorstep (and pay that rider), so there is really no economies of scale to be had here. 

As such, the irony here is that more people ordering food online actually means bigger losses for these companies. And the only way to stem these losses is to charge higher prices. They can’t take a higher cut from the restaurants than they already are, so that leaves the consumer in the form of higher fees and / or minimum orders. 

Under normal circumstances, competition is likely stiff enough, and the orders so few that the food delivery companies won’t dare to do such a thing. Right now, there are probably enough people using their services that these companies are comfortable raising prices. Yes, some might get turned off by this (but who are you going to switch to really), but there would still be enough customers left who are willing to pay their higher asking prices. 

That’s just my take at least. They are firing their worst customers, defined as those who are not earning them any money. And I don’t blame them. I believe that one side-effect of this pandemic is the acceleration of existing trends, and given the current lack of profitability of these food delivery companies, it felt inevitable really.",2020-05-17 12:01:05,27,,,/r/singapore/comments/gl7c7z/anyone_going_to_talk_about_money_minting_by_grab/

Prior to CB, cheaper delivery + greater convenience(vs what the market provided) was gained from using their service, which came at the cost of Grab's equity. Someone was paying for the benefit customers accrued.

So right now they are trying to head at least towards the direction of breaking even by raising prices. On top of that, the companies have loss a lot of goodwill(hard to quantify but valuable) with their customers. I believe the market will vote with their wallets on this.

Maybe this can even settle this experiment that transport/delivery prices have found its equilibrium.

ngrenjie,"$14.50 service fee is ridiculous, but who am I to criticise the consumer if they are willing to pay that much? Though the last few times I checked the grab app, their delivery fee has largely remained constant at $3 to $3.50, so this higher pricing might be confined to certain areas with higher volume of orders. 

So yay for living in a more ulu portion of Bukit Panjang? 😛 

I am currently on a Foodpanda monthly plan, where I pay $8 a month for 15 free deliveries (and I used all 15 last billing cycle, for a savings of $37). My mom and I don’t cook, so on other occasions, we either get food from the coffee shop downstairs (and supplement with canned food), or eat bread / instant noodles. 

I am going to assume that Foodpanda absorbs the cost of this promotion. My orders range from $18 (Wok hey) to $30 (Flaming Don) for two people, so I estimate that Foodpanda is not really earning all that much from me. 

The article you linked to also has some inconsistencies. Since Grab is the company handling the payment processing, they will likely be the ones to absorb the credit card fees as well (and I suspect their use of paylater is a bid to cut down on processing fees by consolidating all the receipts into one lump sum). 

But yeah, I did switch from Grabfood back to Foodpanda early this year when Grab significantly cut back on their promotions, and their use of paylater meant I am not able to benefit from my credit card rewards the same way I do with Foodpanda.

JokerMother,"Hmm extremely good points. My thinking was along the line of, if they provide the subscription previously when deliveries weren’t as high a demand, why would they remove it when demand is up and they’re presumably earning more? Unless I’m retarded and they’re actually making a loss from the increased demand in deliveries. I mean it’s nice for companies to have a little empathy for the small group of people but that’s in an idealistic world which we’re clearly not in. Definitely don’t have the intention to bring down the business. 

I admit, i might be taking it a little personally. I have always been a huge fan of grab and have been supporting them since the start, loyal to 3 subscriptions, 1 being the free delivery even when I didn’t need to deliver as much before the CB. However it’s kind of frustrating for right now as I have to serve SHN, thanks ns! So when I actually had more use for the coupons, they came and remove it. Adding salt onto wound, delivery fees has steeply been increased. What was $4 before CB is now suddenly at $8. I wouldn’t be this frustrated if I had the choice to opt for pick up. My grandmother also have been unable to leave her house and calling delivery for her was the best choice. 

I mean being in an oligopoly does have its perks even if the consumers suffer.",2020-05-17 14:51:05,-3,,,/r/singapore/comments/gl7c7z/anyone_going_to_talk_about_money_minting_by_grab/

1) Restaurants are not overloaded. They have lost over 50% of business, and hence they are providing extended delivery to increase sales. Grab is charging upwards of 30% commission to restaurants , thereby leading restaurants to lower profit % to increase sales in order to pay their employees. So it is grabs profit again

2) I have spoken to few delivery guys. While the number of orders has in fact increased (they are typically doing 1.2x orders), the incremental money they are making is negligible.

thatsmyshirt,"Ehhh it's either illegal or not, not halfway. And what's your basis for alleging bad faith? They never cheat you of your money what.

For both Grab and Deliveroo, there are clear clauses reserving the right to change the benefits under the subscription plans subject to notice being given by email or in-app prior to implementation (for Deliveroo) and notices given via email it in-app two billing cycles beforehand (for Grab). 

Both services also clearly reserve the right of termination at their discretion, and you are also not charged if the subscription is cancelled. You also have an ongoing month by month subscription and as consumer you are also entitled to cancel at any time (within a billing cycle). Not unreasonable right?

These clauses are pretty prominently displayed in the short summarised version of Grab's T&C, and is the third and forth bullet point under the first clause you see for Deliveroo Plus. They gave you prior notice, how is it bad faith? 

If you never read the T&Cs because you blindly click that you did and subscribe, **that's on you**. If you never check your email and missed the notice or dismissed the in-app notification, that's also on you. Deliveroo's terms entitle you to cancel with immediate effect after you receive a notice of change, and you get a refund of what you paid for that month. It's a fair exchange between willing buyer, willing seller.

VelvetGlider,"My comment was not off-topic, because you were the one who brought up the statement that almost everyone relies on delivery. I keep seeing you reply to comments saying they’re off-topic, when they’re addressing something else you said. You can’t facilitate a meaningful discussion if everything needs to somehow tunnel-vision to your main point.

That aside, let me address your main point. I assume you know about supply and demand. Since the demand is spiking, if they kept everything at the status quo, it wouldn’t make sense to their shareholders, the people who invest money in the company. Given that Grab isn’t a running a charity, and is profit-oriented, why wouldn’t they increase delivery fees to make more money? You can feel free to boycott them, but they’re not doing anything wrong.

Addressing your ‘extended logic’, it isn’t very logical. Grab isn’t monopolising life-saving insulin, or something you cannot live without. If restaurants increase prices to a point where you can’t afford it, feel free to cook at home. They have access to cooking utensils and ingredients, and so do you.

aortm,"except he might be acting as a vector for viral spread. Above comment implied ~ 6-10$ com per delivery. assuming 1 delivery per household, he met with over 700-1000 families over this month. 

There's 8000 cases out of 6million population, very conservative estimate 1 infected out of 750. This doesn't even count the asymptomatic people who might outnumber that 8000 by 2-3 times. 

He's very likely to have visited a family with symptomatic person by the end of the month once. virus hops on him, he's asymptomatic, but shares it with the rest of the 1000 families he meets.

>So he, and by extension of your reasoning, all delivery men should not be out delivering food? And food parcels, and groceries etc?

He shouldn't be doing the numbers he's doing.

Many of us aren't meeting friends anymore, its to cut down on the number of people that could possibly be infected. Don't do what's unnecessary.

Delivering food is necessary, but exploiting the high period to make a buck is wholly irresponsible.

>He’s doing his job to help us get food, you don’t think he deserves the money?

>Are you jelly about the money he earns?

Deserves? Sure he does. For the labour he's putting in, of course he deserves to be properly compensated. He has to be working 70-80 hour weeks to get there.

Jelly? perhaps. But not for the money, but the lack of responsibility he has shown. He can earn all he wants with little care, he risks himself and his customers, but since government is paying for his medical bills if he does get infected, why would he stop the cashflow?

There are certainly other ways of making extra cash a month that doesnt endanger the lives of others.

>If x number if people visits your house to provide food, What difference does it make if x is by the same person?

>If y number of customers dial for food, what is the difference if 100% of y deliveries were made by the same version vs made by z number of people?

Best case scenario, little clustering occurs. Viral cases are restricted to linked families. This occurs when delivery orders to persistent families are equally spread amongst all deliveryman to reduce house-to-house contamination.

Realistic scenario, small clustering occurs tied to 1 deliveryman visiting affected family then moving on. This occurs when uneven distribution of orders, that 1 guy gets more orders than others -> visit more families -> more chances of visiting someone infected -> more families visit and infect by virtue of having more orders. Of course this is a portion luck as well, as the casual deliveryman with less orders may be the one who has to visit the infected family, and cluster is small, but probability again is smaller than above.

Worst case scenario. 1 big cluster. Absolute inequality, if 1 person does all deliveries, Just 1 family is infected and he risks all of them.

So yes there is a difference, this guy is unfortunately closer to the bad end of case scenario continuum, considering he's at the end of the bell curve, ie probably has most orders?",2020-04-20 16:12:10,-70,,,/r/singapore/comments/g4o1n5/topearning_deliveroo_rider_in_spore_earned_s7095/

The tricky part about bell curve grading is that in order to get to the 99th percentile, you'll have to climb over a significant number of people. Being above-average isn't gonna do you much good since you'd still be stuck near the crest; you've gotta be god-like.

b0bbywasabi,"When I first started, Grabfood hasn’t launched yet, it was still Ubereats. I chose Panda simply because in my residential area, it was obvious panda was the dominant player at the time (there were much more panda riders compared to others). Normally riders would work in the neighbourhood where they live due to the familiarity. 

I think one major point most non-riders are not aware of is the flexibility of work. For roo and grab, they can simply turn on their app and their status will be online and they can start working for however long they want until they decide to log out and be offline. As for panda, you have to book shifts one week in advance and there are limited slots for different times throughout the day. You can’t just simply log in and be online to start work, and those shifts vary in duration. 

My observation during Circuit breaker, there was one weekend where there were many Grab riders with no orders because a whole bunch of them went online but there was not a proportionate demand for orders. For panda I feel that by having shifts it makes sure at each time of the day there is a certain number of riders to proportionately meet demand so it ensures when we work there are orders. But in terms of other normal days, if I can’t book shift, I lose out and can’t work whereas Grab and Roo riders have the most flexibility in this. 

In terms of earnings, it’s hard for me to say which platform you can earn more because I haven’t tried all of them. I can only say, I’ve been in the game long enough to experience 3 different types of services fee structures from foodpanda, namely: hourly + order, distance + order, and order based only. The latter is the current one and I feel it is the one which I have been earning the most.

,"Percentage based commission doesn’t make sense for the merchants. E.g let’s assume a 30% commission on a $10 order = $3 for Grab. But if the order is $100 then 25% commission = $25. Grab’s cost doesn’t change at all whether the order is $10 or $100 because it’s still one single rider doing the delivery, so what Grab is doing is losing money on the smaller orders in the hopes that they will have enough big orders to cover their losses. 

One solution is to move away from percentage based to a rate structure such as:
-	$X for orders $10 or below
-	$X*1.3 for orders between $10-$19.99
-	$X*1.6 for orders between $20-$29.99
and so on...

The main problem with delivery is that it’s always a value-losing proposition with small orders because of the disproportionately high percentage of cost to order value. At the same time, the majority of orders are small orders. This is not a problem that can be easily solved.",2020-05-09 10:08:55,-1,,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

They’ve also been adding more “along the way” jobs to delivery so the overall topup gets even lower. 2x typical $5/jobs suddenly becomes 1x $9/2jobs.

ngrenjie,"Your solution doesn’t seem that much different from a percentage-based commission structure. The cut is still based on the order amount. 

I agree with your analysis that smaller deliveries are not worth it, but look at it this way. Your delivery crew still have to be paid regardless of whether they are working or not. If you set the minimum order limit too high and too few people order, this means your manpower is seriously going under-utilised. 

One solution I can think of is if you can get customers to place their order way in advance, which may then give the company time to consolidate the orders and see how best to deploy their manpower. For example, perhaps the software could identify that 4 of the orders from say, Streats at BPP are going to families living in the same block. One driver could then be instructed to collect them all and deliver them all at one shot, rather than having 4 different people make 4 separate trips. 

This would mean that the company doesn’t need to hire as many delivery people, which may cut down on their costs.",2020-05-09 10:58:10,-1,,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

OTOH, the actual value that GF/FP/Doo bring to the client resto *and* the paying customer is *discovery*, for which I can see paying the current markups — *once.* It would be interesting if one of the bigs were to rebrand themselves as a ""local restaurant discovery service"", admit up front that they take (the current cut) *for the first order*, with 1/3 to 1/2 the cut for subsequent orders from the same customer to the same client. I bet they'd do better than people seem to think. Would it be *enough* better to turn a sustainable profit?

jmzyn,"Optimal route? That is total BS.
It’s more like slotting any additional order nearby and re-sorting the sequence after.

I’ll give you an example:
collect from Dhoby Ghaut, deliver to Somerset.
Then in between, they slot in an another order: collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton..

You would have thought, hey wow, one straight line... optimal! 
BUT their sequence WILL be re-sorted to collect from Dhoby Ghaut, collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton, deliver to Somerset just because you have to collect all your orders first before you start delivering. So if you are the customer waiting at Somerset, good luck to you. And even lagi good luck to you if Orchard is a long waiting queue BBT shop and customer at Newton decides to be pesky and not include their full address or pick up the rider’s call.

PS: it is their guideline to follow the sequence because you are supposed to update the app upon every collection, delivery action. So if suddenly, your delivery is at your door even when you did not receive that auto “your food is on the way” message, it’s most likely because the rider improvised at a risk of not adhering to their guidelines.",2020-05-09 08:36:21,19,,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

ngrenjie,"A lot of them have websites that are seriously CMI. I tried ordering McDonald’s using their own app and the experience was frankly terrible. Food came late and there were missing orders. Never had an issue with Grab. 

We can crap on the Foodpanda / deliveroo / Grabfood companies all we want, but the key reason why we keep going back to their apps is because they are so easy to use. I open the app, select the food I want, key in my address and make payment. Foodpanda and Deliveroo even support Apple Pay, which meant that for the longest time, I didn’t even need to key in my credit card details. 

It also means that I don’t need to have half a dozen restaurant apps or websites saved on my phone as well. 

If you ask me, it feels wasteful for each restaurant to manage their own delivery crew. From an efficiency standpoint, it makes more sense for something like this to be centralised so that the company can deploy manpower to whichever restaurant needs more support at any one time, allowing each eatery to focus solely on preparing their food.

jdickey,"Yeah, you're right. Web design here seems stuck in the late 1990s, particularly with regard to language support (the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/ws/languages) are probably still the gold standard here).

I also basically agree that having scores of different delivery fleets is wasteful and a business opportunity in its own right. Maybe, if the bigs don't make their payment scheme more sustainable for the restos and ethical for the customers, an association of restaurateurs could organise a cost-neutral delivery system. Order from whatever restaurant you like, either through their app or the association's, and the association's delivery drivers will get your food to your door.

Advantages over the current system:

* Delivery as a cost-neutral (commercial non-profit) service;
* Lower prices to the customer, and the ability for individual restaurants to experiment with their own promotions more than is presently done; and, not least
* Money made here stays here, and isn't spent on servicing the (all international) bigs' debt.

Doing a multilingual Web/phone app with modern tooling isn't as hard as the way most Singapore sites go about it, and so having an independent, *fully local* site/app with broad visibility and uptake would be a much-needed wake-up call to cheap-at-any-cost Singaporean businesses' Web sites. (20 years' Web development speaking here; the local Web environment is positively *enraging* to anybody who knows anything about modern standards. A good site drives engagement; that first *g* should never be an *r* in a consumer-driven industry.)",2020-05-09 17:33:22,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

Once I'm halfway to the customer's location then I will turn on the other one and accept any orders that come in.

Food delivery businesses around the world are running at a breakeven or loss. They are priced to throw competitors under the bus and bleed them dry (promo code, free delivery offers all not ""no cost"", it eats up into their margin, which is razor thin already), not to make money (or only make money if they are the monopoly or subsidised by other arms that aren't making money now, like Grab and it's ridesharing).",2020-04-30 14:28:55,29,,,/r/singapore/comments/gapc15/deliveroo_lays_off_25_of_singapore_staff_amid/

The-Darkest-Knight,"Just received an e-mail from them, looks like they moved it forward.

Here's the e-mail I got:

>**Changes to your fees** From today, you’ll begin to see a ‘minimum spend’ of $18 displayed for Plus free delivery in-app. Your subscription means that you don't pay any delivery fee, as long as the order meets the minimum spend for that restaurant - no matter how far the delivery is or how often you order.

For those that order for a family or with their partners, this isn't going to make a huge difference. Your average order for 2 people via Deliveroo is going to be $25 at the very least.

This however, does impact anyone that orders just for one like people living by themselves or with flatmates. $18 for one person for a single meal is pretty high.

This is probably a strategy to remove exactly those people from their subscription base and focus on bigger margins for themselves with less orders rather than razor thin margins (or negative) with low order values.

Overall, Plus subscribers that are single or order for one:

1. Cancel their subscription out of annoyance and order with FoodPanda or GrabFood and pay the same delivery fee. Those guys have more inventory / restaurants on their apps.
2. Those that are living with flatmates probably have one or more people subscribed, so all but one will keep their subscription and they'll end up ordering together.
3. Order lunch and dinner together. Keep dinner, heat it up later.",2020-05-01 19:00:15,11,,,/r/singapore/comments/gbfvn0/deliveroo_plus_started_to_implement_18_minimum/

Deliveroo is popular in the central region but for the neighbourhood region, you'll be lucky to get 1 deliveroo order in 4 hours. Some riders will keep deliveroo's app on while working for the other 2 companies.

Successful_Economics,"ok the people on this subreddit are very ignorant and love pretending to be woke about LGBT rights, so here's an explanation that you could have googled in 2 seconds

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkwashing\_(LGBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkwashing_(LGBT))

&#x200B;

**Pinkwashing** is a portmanteau word which combines ""pink"" and ""whitewashing"". The term is most often used to describe various forms of cause marketing. ...**Pinkwashing** (LGBT) – the promotion of the gay-friendliness of a corporate or political entity **in an attempt to downplay or soften aspects of it considered negative.**

&#x200B;

now, why is deliveroo pinkwashing? maybe it has to do with its exploitative practices wrt classifying its riders as independent contractors (for reference, the employment tribunal lawsuit in the UK) to cut costs and deny them traditional employment protections.

&#x200B;

nothing wrong with individuals turning up for gay pride. but corporations - particularly irresponsible ones like deliveroo - can fuck off.",2019-06-07 02:09:12,14,,,/r/singapore/comments/bxg02w/kudos_to_deliveroo_for_recognising_lgbt_rights_a/

It’s the bare minimum Singapore companies can do for LGBT and it’s not like they can contribute anything more since the government actively bans everything that is LGBT related. 

They changed to a rainbow icon and suddenly it “preys on younger people’s pocket”. So are you saying that no company should never promote LGBT awareness because everything they do is not for the benefits of the LGBT people? So how do you suggest Singapore get the words out when the government is censoring anything LGBT related?

PartTimeBomoh,"So yeah I don’t believe in moral relativism, but if you do then there’s a fundamental difference of opinion that is hard to argue further. It’s basically giving up your autonomy and saying, the moral trends are what they are, leave them be. I think the impact on all of us is too significant to be leaving something this important up to chance or the trend of the day.

My perspective on human rights:
The freedom of the individual ends where it infringes on the freedom of society.

We don’t give people the “human right to murder” because it infringes on the right of others to life.

On the other hand, being gay doesn’t really infringe on the freedom of anyone else. It’s laughable that people think they should be allowed to dictate who someone else loves just because it makes them “uncomfortable”.

So in the cost benefit analysis I find it really hard to support gay discrimination.

Deliveroo has stopped assigning food delivery orders to riders on  personal mobility devices (PMDs), as the zero-tolerance stance for the  electric scooter footpath ban kicked in yesterday.

Any existing PMD riders who have not switched vehicles or applied for  the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) e-scooter trade-in grant by the  deadline on Tuesday will not be able to continue working for Deliveroo  until ""they confirm they would like to switch vehicles"", said a  Deliveroo spokesman.

Two errant e-scooter users flouting the rules - one in Yishun and the  other in Sengkang - have been caught by enforcement officers, said the  LTA in a Facebook post yesterday evening. They could be fined up to  $2,000, jailed for up to three months, or both.

LTA enforcement officers were patrolling in areas such as Ang Mo Kio, Punggol, Sengkang, Sembawang and Yishun yesterday.

Besides taking strict enforcement action against errant e-scooter  users, the officers continued checks on active mobility devices to  ensure they complied with the authorities' safety criteria.

Under the new rules, users of e-scooters are banned from riding their  devices on the 5,500km of footpaths in Singapore. This means that the  use of e-scooters, which are already banned on roads, will be confined  to the 440km of cycling paths.

The footpath ban started on Nov 5, following a series of e-scooter-related accidents.

Up until  Tuesday, the authorities had been issuing warnings to errant riders,  but its zero-tolerance policy for the offence took effect yesterday.

Once crowded with PMDs, the footpaths around Compass One shopping  mall in Sengkang appeared to be devoid of e-scooters when The Straits  Times visited yesterday morning.

At least six LTA enforcement officers were patrolling the grounds.  But for three hours, ST did not see any e-scooters on footpaths and  roads around Compass One.

But it was a different story when ST visited Causeway Point in  Woodlands in the afternoon. No enforcement officers were in sight.

In 30 minutes, ST observed seven e-scooter users on footpaths. Three  were food delivery riders from Foodpanda and GrabFood and another three  were young riders who blasted music as they rode.

The last user was a mother ferrying her young daughter to tuition  class. She said she had no idea that the ban came into effect yesterday.

""Nobody told me. I thought it was banned only in May! Now that I  know, I will stop using my e-scooter,"" said Madam Huang, who declined to  give her full name.

Bicycles and personal mobility aids such as motorised wheelchairs are allowed on footpaths, cycling paths and park connectors.

But the ban will progressively be extended to other motorised PMDs in  the first quarter of this year, including hoverboards and unicycles.

All of the food delivery riders ST spoke to were aware of the  footpath ban. Some of them have swopped their e-scooters for bicycles,  power-assisted bicycles and motorcycles after the new rules were  announced last November.

Mr Zuraime Yangakub, who has been a full-time delivery rider for  GrabFood for six months, is one of them. He has been cycling for two  months and said he has lost 8.5kg since making the switch.

""Last time on e-scooter, I could earn $100 in eight hours, but now on  bicycle I have to work 12 hours to earn that amount. The impact is  huge,"" said the 46-year-old, who is aiming to get a motorcycle licence  so that he can change vehicles in the near future.

DuePomegranate,"It's better than doing nothing, and better than the other 2 companies. At least Deliveroo has taken a stance (even if mainly to protect their own ass).

My thoughts, use a card for family expense and another for personal expense. As for cash back, aim for new cards reward. Most of the banks, especially international banks gives welcome rewards for new card holders. For example, HSBC gives $180 for $800 spending. That is like a 6 months of rebates assuming a 3% return on a 1k monthly spending, assuming you can optimise your spending to achieve a 3% returns. Standard chartered or AMEX gives similar amount in cash or in kinds (Apple Watch, ear pods). This is in comparison to $30 welcome gift for existing customers. How do you qualify as a new customer, you may ask. The definition for all banks are “non card holder for 12 months”. So if you cancel your card and reapply a new card 12 months later, you are considered a new customer. 

The plan, apply for a HS (or other banks cards), make the minimum spend and take the welcome gift, hold for 6 months and cancel it thereafter. Apply for the same card 12 months after.",2021-02-14 15:32:54,10,,,/r/singapore/comments/ljj266/best_cash_back_credit_card_setup_in_singapore_and/

,"Actually, never put money into any form of pre-paid unless u are going to spend it off within the next few days. Once your money is in, service can change, product can alter but your money is stuck.

It also encourages you to spend/use more by simply because you have ""already paid"" one lump sum, that reduces the pain of paying every single transaction in the future. When u think you can save $5 off every $100 deposit, you are not. U do not save $5, u spent $95 unnecessarily and subtlety. That will justify u into putting more n saving more next time because u ""experienced"" the benefit of $5 off per $100 afterall.

Take a step back. Without the deposit, u probably spend less as every transaction is being thought through, u spend only on the essentials.

From what I see, their finance branch seems to be burning more money than they are bringing in, so what exactly is their endgame here?",2020-12-01 10:27:28,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/k4aver/psa_if_you_care_about_your_money_please_avoid/

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Impossible Foods' plant-based 'meat' available on Deliveroo from May 21

> SINGAPORE — Vegans, vegetarians and those who have a taste for plant-based food items may soon have more choices when ordering meals online.

> From May 21, food delivery company Deliveroo is partnering exclusively with American food company Impossible Foods to offer dishes and meals made from its plant-based products.

> They will be on the menu of eight restaurant brands with a total of 33 outlets in Singapore, namely Fatboy’s the Burger Bar, FatPapas, Omakase Burger, Oriole Coffee + Bar, PappaRich, PS Cafe, Three Buns, and Wolf Burger.

> Impossible Foods develops meat alternatives made from plants.

> Deliveroo’s general manager Siddharth Shanker said: “We’ve seen a surge in demand for vegan or plant-based options in the past couple of years.”

> Orders from vegetarian or vegan restaurants on its platform have gone up from 7 per cent in 2017 to 10 per cent in January this year.

> Diners in Singapore have also been receptive to Impossible Foods’ meat substitutes so far, Deliveroo said.

> Impossible Foods launched its plant-based meat in Singapore earlier in March by partnering eight restaurants, including Potato Head, Bread Street Kitchen by Gordon Ramsey and Cut by Wolfgang Puck.

> The restaurants serve dishes containing the kosher and halal-certified “beef” from Impossible Foods.

> Deliveroo noted that four restaurants have seen a 15 per cent average increase in patrons since they started serving dishes from Impossible Foods.

> Mr Shanker said: “Introducing Impossible Foods on Deliveroo fits our strategy to offer more plant-based foods with a lower environmental impact.”

> Impossible Foods is known for its Impossible Burger, made primarily from soy and potato proteins, coconut oil and sunflower oil.

> The company genetically modifies yeast and uses fermentation to produce an iron-containing molecule called heme, which creates the flavour of meat and gives the patty its red colour.

> The Impossible Burger is said to be more environment-friendly than one with a conventional ground beef patty, as it requires less water and land to produce while emitting less greenhouse gases and water pollutants.

> On the latest development, Impossible Foods’ director of international launches Jordan Sadowsky said: “With nearly half of global meat consumption coming from Asia, it’s been a priority for us to find more ways to expand in the region.”

eliseusmoo,"Not sure for impossible food's patties but I think beyond burger's patties are available in certain NTUC. Although they go for a whopping of $12.50 (2 patty). Essentially $6.25 per vegan patty.

I like the idea of their 'saving meat, saving earth' notion but I think it's abit too much for those kinds of pricetag. Yes I do understand that it's alot of work and all for them to come up with it but from doing some simple research, it seems like they've been having and getting alot of support and funding so it really baffles me as to why their stuff are/going to be priced so premiumly? Is it because of novelty? Wanting to replace traditional meat with 'meat' shouldn't actually cost the end-user/consumer an arm or an leg if the goal in the first place was to be green earth. 

I've tried it and really love it but if i were to be real honest, I probably wouldn't replace my diet or wallet's health for this, mainly due to the absurd pricetag. Which in turn, defeats the purpose of them creating this in the first place as they want people to stop consuming meat and use their product instead for replacement.",2019-05-16 19:26:21,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/bpaauw/impossible_foods_plantbased_meat_available_on/

It isn't applicable towards replacement of something with more structure, like steak.

If we think about climate change in general, I think that moving away from beef into chicken and farmed fish is far more environmentally friendly.

> SINGAPORE: An electric-scooter rider on his way to deliver food to a customer collided with a three-year-old boy in a corridor of a mall in Serangoon, causing the child to fall backwards.

> Neo Jia Ming, 20, who was a Deliveroo rider back then, collided into the child outside a shop on the fourth level of Nex Mall on Mar 18.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Neo, who was also serving national service at the time, pleaded guilty on Thursday (Jun 27) to one charge of riding his e-scooter rashly and endangering the personal safety of the victim.

> The court was shown closed-circuit television footage depicting the incident. The boy's mother was sitting outside the Gift Greetings shop at the mall while her son and husband were in the store.

> The corridor was crowded, with people streaming through at about 7pm that day. Neo was riding his e-scooter along the corridor when he knocked into the boy just outside the shop, as the child was walking towards his mother.

> The boy fell backwards and hit his head against the floor, sustaining a bruise that measured 3cm by 3cm.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Neo dismounted from his e-scooter and gave the boy's mother his name and contact number, before continuing to make his delivery.

> The boy's mother later lodged a police report.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Lai told the court that he would not be objecting to probation for Neo.

> He said Neo's speed was ""not that fast"" and that he was not ""blazing through the corridor"". He added that the reason ""we prosecuted this case was that it was a crowded corridor"".

> To ride an e-scooter in a crowded mall places others in danger, said the prosecutor.

> District Judge May Mesenas agreed, and asked Neo, who was unrepresented, if he had anything to say.

> Neo said: ""I will never ride in a mall again next time.""

> He told the judge that he ""just got a proper job"" in logistics. She called for a probation suitability report and adjourned the case to Jul 25.

> The maximum penalties for causing hurt by a rash act are a year's jail, a S$5,000 fine, or both.

Not sure how much DRoo or FP paid their riders, but i get paid $6 per delivery. Plus $2 extra if there is high demand peak hours.
Grabeat can be funny too. I was near Pasir Ris Downtown East and got order request at tampines mall to deliver food to Kaki Bukit. With motorycycle or e-scooter, it wont be a problem. But with bicycle, there might be some delay. 
And then when you reach the outlet, especially McD during dinner time, you need to wait more before the foods are prepared. So customer have to wait longer than expected. Feel srry for them most of the time.

It happened a few times that i got more than 4km to pick up foods with bicycle. I think Grab need to improve the rider app or they just dont have many motorcycle rider. This never happened with ubereats. 

I could do 10 or more deliveries with Ubereats per day but now with Grabeat I can do max 7 or 8 deliveries because the distance tired me to death ",2018-07-04 19:05:33,10,,,/r/singapore/comments/8vyxea/deliveroo_introduces_halalonly_delivery_bags_in/

How I know enough or not for the sensitive muslims. How do *you* know? You are not them, you don't get to tell them how they should have things. Just like they don't get to tell you or I to eat halal. That's religious freedom, right? How is that goondoo?

They asked for it, Deliveroo said ""OK sure"". Deliveroo doesn't take anything away from you. Deliveroo is making the bet that this will make them more money and open up the market more for muslims. If they die, they die. If they make money, they make money. You still have foodpanda and other services. That's market freedom, right? How is that goondoo?

There are valid criticisms to make. Like, how to ensure Deliveroo driver keep food properly? How to ensure bags are safely secured? Won't it be a bit wasteful to have one giant empty bag if there are no halal deliveries? To me all of these are reasonable things to talk about. 

But here in this thread everyone just complain muslims being treated like overly special snowflakes. If you don't eat halal food, it doesn't affect you. Complain for the sake of complain only. It has racist overtones.

If this is a question, I honestly don't know the answer to it. But this is besides the point, because what you actually said was this: 

> Just have a zippered section of your bag specifically for halal food. Not difficult to get that sewn in. Non halal food never goes in there right?

> Why must go and gek gao introduce entirely halal bags? Smh speaks more about the intolerance of the sensitive muslims.

This is not an honest question. It's you implying that they the zippered section should be good enough, and that a second bag is not necessary. You are, in effect, making a demand that things be another way. 

There is a term for this. It's called JAQing off. You are actually making a statement, but when someone says you shouldn't be, you hide behind it being ""just asking question"". 

> Simi sai resentment?

and 

> hate this argument.

> > Muslims never asked for it

> Muslims also choose to exclude non-halal places. Rest of us are expected to be collateral damage and suck it up.

If this does not evince resentment, I don't know what does. 

Then you do the classic thing of saying ""I LOVE MY MUSLIM FRIENDS, I AM SO GENEROUS, I AM A VICTIM"": 

> I not so tiki, I eat halal food with my Muslim friends. OK, I love my Muslim friends and food is small issue. My love for my friends triumph the choice of food I have. Still racist anot?

So you see, given that context, when you say things like this: 

> Please lah, that's called being tolerant, respectful and accepting of one another's belief. Which is precisely what some of you need to learn before you keep pulling out the victim and racist card when we just happen to have opposing viewpoints.

It is, truly, you who are pulling the victim card. I don't think you simply have an opposing viewpoint... I think you genuinely resent that they got special treatment when they asked for it. And I think your comment history very clearly shows the same. 

> And lastly, the very fact that there has not been any such hypothetical movement is because other people have been tolerant and accepting. 

No, it's because other people don't have food requirements like that AND the minimum size to affect the market. It's hard for Jews to get kosher food here, for example. Too few of them. It's hard for people with allergies or medically-induced dietary restrictions to purchase food here. Again, too few of them. 

Honestly, if you want to ask for a special non-beef bag, I say go for it. Whether Deliveroo says yes or no, you have the right to ask. You don't need to suck thumb one corner.  

> Your ""market force"" is just some ""sensitive"" people who want everyone else to follow whatever they demand and they will complain to whatever company until they get it. And that is just saying it like it is.

Except that the muslim community has not actually done this??? There are other delivery services that can provide them with this service. Honestly, if Deliveroo said no and they DEMAND and INSIST, then they are just complaining, I will also go tell them to fly kite. 

It's just that here, Deliveroo said yes. And what I am saying is, also nothing wrong what. Willing buyer, willing seller. What's the problem? ",2018-07-04 22:23:52,-1,,,/r/singapore/comments/8vyxea/deliveroo_introduces_halalonly_delivery_bags_in/

theony,"> Amazing that you can come to this conclusion and still defend it as ""not being intolerant"".

You seem genuinely curious and I will give you the benefit of the doubt that you are not being sarcastic. 

It's one thing for muslims to say ""hey, if you don't do this thing for me, I won't buy from you"". Then the answer is simple. Don't buy!

If the seller then agrees to provide the service, all is peachy.  

Muslims are only being intolerant if they demand it and don't accept no for an answer. If Deliveroo had said no, and muslims complained, write to MUIS, write to minister, then I would have told them to kindly go and find a service that will cater to them or start their own. 

The complaints in this thread are even more baffling because Deliveroo isn't going exclusively muslim. The non-halal options remain. Nothing is being taken away from existing customers. Something is being added, so that new customers can be served. 

The only thing I can think of in this situation is that people are being anti-muslim. The top comment is ""Wa the air from non halal food touch the halal food will die is it?"". Can you tell me, is there a clearer way of showing that the general response in this sub is anti-muslim? The top comment mocks their choices, and it's the top comment because it's the most upvoted. The other guy who is replying to me is literally saying he resents that he has to cater to muslim food tastes (""Muslims also choose to exclude non-halal places. Rest of us are expected to be collateral damage and suck it up.""). If you think that these responses are not anti-muslim I would love to hear your reasoning as to why. 

In Singapore, having this underlying anti-muslim sentiment is dangerous as fuck. I hear colleagues complain about the company catering for a separate halal fridge (it's actually only in one location and the space is in proportion to the muslim / non-muslim split). I come to this subreddit and I see this kind of very clear anti-muslim sentiment and it terrifies me. 

Our country is not physically big enough to take this kind of anti-muslim hit. Internally I still have to talk to my muslim neighbour, go to reservist with my muslim buddies, work with my muslim colleagues, have my kids be friends with my muslim buddy's kids. Externally all our neighbours are majority muslim countries with politicians who would be only too happy to use any anti-muslim sentiment here as leverage for their own populations and to undermine us. 

That /r/Singapore, the Singaporean subreddit, supposed-to-be-better-than-stomp/mothershit/edmw/toc/etc., is thinking this way, is fucking terrifying. 

To answer your second question, I'm going to have to direct you to honestly examine the way you have phrased it: 

> Did they ask because they felt that the insulation between halal goodness and kafir filth was intolerably inadequate?

Does this sound like a question you would ask your muslim buddy to his or her face? If you had just said ""halal and non-halal"" that would be a neutral statement. But you said ""halal goodness and kafir filth"". Use that exact phrasing and see how they react, because I promise you for anyone past the age of edgy, it will not be pretty.

rsg-retrivr,"> #Deliveroo rider whose bicycle had no brakes admits to causing 73-year-old's death

> SINGAPORE - A Deliveroo delivery rider failed to obey a red light signal when he cycled across a pedestrian crossing and hit an elderly pedestrian, causing his death.

> Khairul Hairuman&apos;s view was blocked by a bus on the left lane of Lorong Ah Soo just before the pedestrian crossing, and traffic flow was heavy at the time.

> The 19-year-old, whose bicycle had no brakes and was not designed for use on roads or in public places, admitted to causing the death of Mr Tong Cheng Poh, 73, by doing a rash act at about 5.15pm on April 13 last year.

> Khairul was cycling along the two-lane road towards Upper Paya Lebar Road that evening when he noticed that the traffic light signal was red, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Zu Zhao in court on Tuesday (Jan 16).

> There were many cars on both lanes and an SBS Transit bus stopped on the left. Khairul decided to ride between the vehicles on both lanes.

> As he neared the signalised pedestrian crossing, he mistakenly thought that the traffic light signal had turned green for him, though his view was blocked by the bus on his left.

> He picked up speed to cycle across the pedestrian crossing.

> Mr Cheng was walking very slowly along the pedestrian crossing on a ""green man&apos;&apos; signal when he was struck by Khairul&apos;s bicycle. He died from a head injury the next day.

> The bicycle was inspected and found to have no front and rear brake levers or calipers. But it was fixed with ""coaster brakes&apos;&apos;, a special rear hub brake that operates by turning the pedals backwards.

> It could brake only on its own at very slow speeds, said DPP Lee.

> Khairul knew that the bicycle had never had rear brakes fixed. About a week before the accident, he had removed the faulty front brakes, which were not replaced.

> ""Without either front or rear brakes, the accused would normally use his right foot to step on the rear tyre of the said bicycle to slow down, and it would take at least four to five seconds to stop completely,&apos;&apos; the DPP said.

> DPP Lee is asking for four months&apos; jail to be imposed. He said Khairul ran the red light, knew that his bicycle had no brakes and continued to use it on a public road.

> Khairul, who had no lawyer, told Community Court Judge Eddy Tham that had the victim been in his 40s, he would have survived the accident.

> He said he called for assistance and helped carry the victim to the side of the road and waited for the ambulance.

> Judge Tham postponed sentencing to Feb 6 for the prosecution to make further submissions.

> The maximum penalty for causing death by a rash act is five years&apos; jail and a $5,000 fine.

WikiTextBot,"**Fixed-gear bicycle**

A fixed-gear bicycle (or fixed-wheel bicycle, commonly known in some places as a fixie) is a bicycle that has a drivetrain with no freewheel mechanism. The freewheel was developed early in the history of bicycle design but the fixed-gear bicycle remained the standard track racing design. More recently the ""fixie"" has become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists, offering the advantage of simplicity compared with the standard multi-geared bicycle.

Most bicycle hubs incorporate a freewheel to allow the pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum.

WikiTextBot,"**Vicarious liability**

Vicarious liability is a form of a strict, secondary liability that arises under the common law doctrine of agency, respondeat superior, the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate or, in a broader sense, the responsibility of any third party that had the ""right, ability or duty to control"" the activities of a violator. It can be distinguished from contributory liability, another form of secondary liability, which is rooted in the tort theory of enterprise liability because, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. The law has developed the view that some relationships by their nature require the person who engages others to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing of those others.

True Fixies have no rear brakes. The chain, pedal and gears are* “directly linked”, meaning that power transmission is 1:1. You pedal forwards, wheels turn forward. You pedal backwards, the wheels turn backwards. You don’t pedal, the wheels don’t turn. Imagine if your hand were glued to the bike wheels, the concept is somewhat the same.

Fixed gear bicycles' rear wheels literally lock up when you stop pedaling and resist the cranks. Think of it as a direct connection between the cranks (the thing you pedal on), and the rear wheel, via the chain. When one rotates the other rotates. When one meets resistance, the other one does as well. ",2018-01-16 20:16:09,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/7qqz1d/deliveroo_rider_whose_bicycle_had_no_brakes/

So... sometimes your visitors (websites) tries to come into your computer (country) with a expired passport... sure it’s them because their passports merely expired but the immigration officer (your browser) highlights this to you and ask if you (you’re the president or this “country) want to allow them to come into your country (computer) or not.

SpermWhale,"SSL Certificate- Secure Socket Layer Certificate.

So when you key in your info like credit cards, or other confidential info you don't want others to see, you need this cert.  What it does is it ensure the info is being sent to the correct recipient, and the info you're getting is also from the correct reference.

Example of transaction without SSL.  Carousell.

You can buy things there just by transferring money to a person.  Let's say the seller's name is Brad Pitt.  When you go to Brad Pitt's page, and buy something, he can reply just send this to my bank account, here's the bank account number.  Then you transfer money. He replied, ok i received.  And you wait for the items to arrive.  What if that is not the real Brad Pitt?  What if that's the real Brad Pitt but the the reply was from someone else?  

The SSL cert will help you clear that doubt.  It ensures that you're dealing with the real Brad Pitt.  How to get the certificate?  Well the real Brad Pitt must buy it from the Cert Authority, and put it on their domain.",2018-10-25 08:03:49,7,,,/r/singapore/comments/9qzao5/deliveroocomsg_ssl_certificate_expired/

For non-secured connections, It's easier for hackers to intercept your connection to the website and launch attacks so as to retrieve whatever information you send through the connection.

So that means that even if the website itself does not have any malicious intent, it is still unwise to input any sensitive data into these websites.

Now the cracks are showing. The choices keep dwindling (I live in an area with fantastic food nearby but most of them have disappeared, leaving only the chains); the interface has changed (no longer tells you whether a restaurant has a minimum order up front, it only tells you once you go to the restaurant and then put an order into your cart); the delivery charges have gone up (from $3 to $4+ now, making a stickier and more investor-friendly subscription model the ""better"" choice for consumers by making ad-hoc orders shittier).  

Meanwhile the riders sometimes take your food, or take their time (so the food comes cold). Clearly they aren't being paid enough to care.

khaosdd,">	Honestbee salary - You receive a basic hourly salary of about $6 as well as a commission of about $8 per delivery. Apparently, you could even earn up to $18 per hour as a biker.

Doing a very simple calculation = $18 x 8 hours of work a day x 30 days in a month (If U are desperate for $ or super hardworking) = $4320

Not too sure how many can actually hit this target (maybe the top 1%?) or whether it's some marketing gimmick to attract more to their fleet, but being a delivery rider doesn't sound too bad at all.

Interesting, I have lived in South Buona Vista and currently staying in Clementi, in total two of my order with Foodpanda got cancelled unitl now, that was because the restaurant I placed order with was closed by the time I had ordered and  the foodpanda app didn't reflect that. Also, whenever they cancelled my order they gave me a $5 coupon to make up for it,  so it was ok.

When I contacted customer service they claim a mishap happened with my order. Thinking it strange for two orders in a row to mess up I asked for details on why there was a mishap. They then proceed to say that no notes were recorded from the rider and thus can’t tell me what happened.

But suddenly, after questioning them for a while longer, they suddenly claim that they tried to contact me and my order was picked up by another rider and thus not deliverable. 

So where does the two orders go? Do they throw it away? Two perfectly good about $70 orders? Just because one rider was somewhere in chai chee doing god knows what and another picked up the wrong order? 

I don’t believe that two mishaps can happen like this within two hours with something as simple as “oh a mishap happened we tried contacting you sorry you didn’t pick up so your food is gone now.”

Does anybody else have problems with Deliveroo such as this? Is it only Deliveroo? Why does this happen? Is the boss of all this just sitting on his chair in his office enjoying his millions of dollars without changing the problems we have down here?

dozenapplepies,"> Notably, these food delivery apps are incurring losses and could continue to do so in the next few years as they focus on customer acquisition - a most costly undertaking which usually involves aggressive promotions and unsustainable discount deals - as opposed to profits.


They are losing to customers -  this price war is bad for them but beneficial for us. Once it’s over and there is one clear victor, expect most of their deals to end :(.

The last few times I used Honestbee though, the app was a bit wonky - the status update is always stuck until the rider picks it up. So you won't be able to tell if they're preparing your food etc unless you contact the chat.

> 
> Mr Ismail is one of 200,000 freelancers in Singapore, a group of workers that is expected to grow as the gig economy gains traction.
> 
> While it has meant better take- home pay for some such as Mr Ismail, the Government and economists alike worry about their long- term financial health.
> 
> Another concern is the fact that the job is physically demanding and can be risky.
> 
> Mr Ismail plies the roads from 11.15am to 11.15pm, four or five days a week. He pushes himself to make two to three deliveries an hour in the Orchard area where he is based. That brings his hourly wage to an average of about $21. On top of his $8.50 an hour pay, he earns $4 on weekdays and $6 on weekends for every delivery.
> 
> He has made up to 40 deliveries a day - a record among Deliveroo riders, according to Mr Ismail.

> His own biggest worry is getting injured in an accident on the road. So far, he has only had one minor run-in with a speeding car, which dented the back of his red and black Honda Wave motorbike.

plasticbabyy,An acquaintance of mine once shared that he worked with Deliveroo. He does it by bicycle. I believe the pay is based on the number of deliveries you can make (he mentioned something about how the new riders don’t get a base pay - but not sure how true this is). Seemed pretty profitable when he broke it down to me. Sorry if this isn’t any help. ,2018-09-29 05:03:09,4,,,/r/singapore/comments/9jnhyu/some_questions_regarding_grabfood_foodpanda/
airgel,"I used to cycle for UberEats when that was still a thing. I think it works differently compared to the other services but hopefully I can give you an idea. The salary for UE was on a weekly payout, by order, abt $5-9 per order You can work anytime, but at the same time you aren't guaranteed an order. There are periods of high demand like lunch and dinner and they'll increase the rates to encourage you to work. They also gave me perks to work towards, like $abc bonus if I completed xyz  no of trips in a week.

Personally I feel it's not worth it, pay doesn't scale well with distance travelled, and unless you have ultra stamina, it's difficult to  keep it up and reach the milestones. I tried it bc I like cycling, but in the end it was too tiring and I was fed up with hobo-ing at nex waiting for jobs. Also UE favoured motorcyclists over cyclists so many of the perks that apply to MC riders may not apply to you. Keep in mind that this was under UberEats and idk if the others work differently or not.

the_wild_ginger_man,"The current clear plastic food containers are already somewhat reusable, just wash them out and dry off. Then they can be used a number of times for food storage, packed meals etc before the become discoloured or break or just get plain icky.

Then there’s this new reusable container, how much energy does that consume to produce? What is the average lifespan of the container in deliveries? If the new containers themselves take the same energy and produce the same amount of pollution as 20+ of the current containers, but then only last 10-15 deliveries, is that not more harmful to the environment? 

Then there’s the return journey the containers must take that requires time and energy. The restaurant is unlikely to be so the customers daily route, so it’s going to need another scooter journey to collect it.

It doesn’t seem to be the answer to me, it just looks like someone’s trying to meet a quota regardless.

I’m not suggesting that we reuse our clear plastic containers, I’m suggesting that we look hard at our unsustainable polluting lifestyles and  ask what can society and ourselves do to make eating more sustainable in the long run. 

Personally I have a tiny kitchen and I use it as often as I can. Use glass and metal containers to take meals to eat at work. Eat in at hawkers or restaurants and if getting take out, buy from a place nearby and on the way home so it’s walkable.",2020-11-11 19:19:51,27,,,/r/singapore/comments/js44nc/reusable_containers_for_your_next_food_delivery/

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Reusable containers for your next food delivery?

> SINGAPORE: As more people opt for meals delivered to their doorstep amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the three largest food delivery players in Singapore have made reusable containers an option in the hope of reducing the use of disposable packaging.

> These containers are available for orders made with participating food and beverage (F&B) businesses, which number more than 100 at the moment across Foodpanda, Deliveroo and GrabFood.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The new option is part of ongoing plans to cut down on single-use packaging in food deliveries, said these platforms, although the pandemic and rise in delivery orders have spurred the need for more sustainable alternatives.

> A local study published in June showed that the “circuit breaker”, rolled out in early-April to curb the spread of COVID-19, led to an increase in disposable containers and cutlery usage.

> 

> An extra 1,334 tonnes of plastic waste was generated from takeaway and delivery meals during the two-month period which banned dine-ins at eating places and shuttered schools and most workplaces, the study found.

> The initiative comes at a time when the spotlight is being shone on the impact of single-use plastics on the environment and the role they play in climate change.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Last year, a report by the Centre for International Environmental Law said that the global production and incineration of plastic would add add more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

> The earliest to roll out the new option was Foodpanda which began partnering two reusable container lending services – BarePack and Muuse – in April and July, respectively. It now has 48 F&B businesses on board.

> “We are very committed to reducing waste, especially that of single-use plastics,” said its marketing and sustainability director Laura Kantor.

> Advertisement

> “We explored partnerships with BarePack and Muuse with this in mind, but the pandemic definitely pushed us to increase awareness and adoption of this initiative.”

> 

> GrabFood teamed up with Muuse about a month ago and is currently in a pilot phase with 10 restaurants.

> Over at Deliveroo, which is partnering BarePack, customers have been able to order food in reusable cups and boxes from more than 50 restaurants since Oct 7.

> “With the ongoing initiative, Deliveroo hopes to combat rising disposable packaging waste in the city-state as a result of movement restrictions, especially during the circuit breaker period,” a spokesperson said.

> 

> HOW IT WORKS

> 

> Under the partnerships, both BarePack and Muuse will provide the reusable containers used for deliveries.

> 

> Customers will have to return these containers to either the restaurants they ordered from or any participating merchant. BarePack also offers home collection services.

> 

> Foodpanda said since the launch, delivery and self pick-up orders using these reusable packaging have “more than tripled’ over the last six months.

> Grab and Deliveroo, whose initiatives have just started, did not provide take-up rates.

> 

> Muuse’s chief executive Brian Reilly said its collaborations with the food delivery platforms have been “extremely helpful” in pushing for more to embrace a zero-waste lifestyle.

> “As takeaway and delivery orders shot up since the circuit breaker period kicked in, there has been a significant increase in the use of single-use packaging. However, we believe people were hungry for a change,” he added, noting how its user base tripled from July to September on the back of these new partnerships.

> 

> Barepack’s co-founder and chief executive Roxane Uzureau echoed that: “The delivery additions have certainly made takeaway in reusables much more convenient than simply Bring Your Own.”

> The sharing service started at the end of 2019 by lending its reusable cups and food boxes to restaurants for takeaways. It gradually expanded its network of F&B businesses and now saves about 100 disposable packaging a week, according to Ms Uzureau.

> 

> Barepack’s members get to order food on the delivery platforms for free, while non-members have to pay a deposit of S$6 which will be refunded when they return the reusable containers. There is no time limit for users to return the containers, although each user is only allowed to borrow up to five.

> On the other hand, Muuse charges S$25 to those who do not return their containers after 14 days.

> Muuse said its collaborations with the food delivery platforms have been “extremely helpful” in pushing for more to embrace a zero-waste lifestyle. (Photo: Muuse)

> So far, all reusable containers have been returned promptly, representatives of both sharing services told CNA.

> 

> Foodpanda said the return process is “fuss-free” as customers will be given instructions, while Deliveroo noted that it has not received any reports of customers facing difficulties in returning the containers.

> Once collected, participating F&B businesses will clean the containers before reusing them for new deliveries.

> Asked about hygiene concerns amid the pandemic, Muuse said the cleaning process is done “in line with strict Government regulations governing the use of dine-in tableware and containers”. It added that it conducts regular spot checks and follows updates from the Singapore Food Agency closely.

> 

> Similarly for BarePack, all containers are “cleaned to the same standards” as that of dine-ins. It also worked with Deliveroo to implement “stringent” safety protocols, such as ensuring that reusable containers are “collected away from restaurant serving areas and batch processed with used crockery”.

> 

> WHAT F&B BUSINESSES SAY

> 

> Shake Farm began making deliveries with reusable containers from BarePack and Muuse since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

> 

> “Due to the huge increase of delivery volume and the large amount of takeaway packaging being used every day, it made a lot of sense to use reusable containers,” said its founder Danny Chambers.

> But this only makes up about 5 per cent of its orders – a “considerably low” figure, according to Mr Chambers. “We hope that this will increase considerably in the future as it’s a lot better for the environment,"" he said.

> 

> SaladStop!, Heybo and Wooshi, which offers the reusable options via Deliveroo, said they registered an average of 5 such orders a day since the initiative began in early-October.

> 

> BarePack’s reusable containers have been made available for takeaways at these stores since February, said Ms Katherine Braha, co-founder and director at Fresh Creation Holdings which manages the three F&B brands.

> The company has been an advocate of the reusable culture in Singapore, encouraging Bring Your Own practices and launching its own reusable merchandise. And with COVID-19 spurring the number of online orders, it saw the partnership between BarePack and Deliveroo as “a great solution to make (its) deliveries more eco-friendly”.

> 

> Asked if the cleaning of the reusable containers could be extra work for its employees, Ms Braha said: “As the BarePack containers are a new set of materials for cleaning, this does add to the workload for our staff.

> 

> “However, we have had BarePack available in our stores since early this year, so staff were already familiar with the collecting and washing procedures.”

> 

> She added: “We anticipate that as more merchants begin to participate in the barePack programme, this responsibility will become better shared.”

> Moving forward, the delivery and container sharing companies are looking to expand the number of participating F&B businesses and increase user rates.

> Muuse said it is working on a rewards programme for its users, alongside plans to make the “return process as easy as possible” and sign up more F&B outlets, according to Mr Reilly.

> The spokesperson for Deliveroo said the company is committed to helping its F&B partners become more sustainable and “will be actively seeking to expand this initiative to more restaurants in coming weeks”.

> 

> Grab’s spokesperson said: “We are gradually onboarding more merchant-partners onto this initiative in the past month and are actively monitoring the feedback and results, as well as working closely with Muuse to design effective ways of making this campaign as meaningful as possible.”

breakbruce,"I am currently a part-time food courier with both UberEats and Honestbee. Here's what I can share about each:

&nbsp;

UberEats:

- You work anytime you want, anywhere. All you have to do to start working is go online on your Uber Driver application.

- If you work on weekday afternoons, I would recommend city area cos everywhere else has pretty much little to no demand

- Weekday nights and weekends are the best time to work UberEats in just about any location.

- Best times to work are 11 AM to 3 PM, 5:45 PM to 9 PM as multipliers tend to be the highest around these times, but it may vary by the day and location.

- I personally average around $11 per hour with added incentives working at Serangoon on weekday and weekend nights, as well as the city area on weekday afternoons but I rarely do the city area now as it is almost an hour away from where I live.

- Payment is calculated from Monday to Sundays, and money is transferred to your account weekly on Thursdays.

Unfortunatedly, I heard UberEats has stopped letting in cyclists as they have an over-supply of them now, so they are only open to motorcylists.

&nbsp;

Honestbee:

- This is slightly better than UberEats in the sense that they have a base $6 pay and $8 per delivery. 

- However, you will have use an application to reserve your work time slots beforehand, unlike UberEats where you can just start working by going online in the applications anytime, anywhere.

- Unfortunatedly, even though the advertised pay is up to $22 per hour assuming base pay plus two deliveries per hour, rarely anyone hits that amount. 

- In fact, most people do not go past a single digit per hour due to the fact that there is a lack of demand and thus deliveries throughout the entire island, irregardless of area.

- However, because there is a base pay, even if there are no orders, you still get to take home something. Get no orders with UberEats and you will be eating grass.

- Just like UberEats, payment is calculated from Monday to Sundays, and money is transferred to your account weekly on Thursdays.

&nbsp;

What I personally do for a typical delivery day:

- I would reserve slots for HonestBee in the afternoon near where I live in Serangoon, where I am paid a hourly base pay and given maybe one or two deliveries. 

- This way, I make around the same amount I would make doing UberEats in the city area in the afternoon, but I do fewer deliveries and spend less time getting cooked in the afternoon sun. And I do not have to spend time travelling to the city area.

- In the evening, I do UberEats instead and take advantage of the dinnertime demand near Nex. If possible, I'll take a slot with Honestbee just before 7 PM since demand for UberEats does not start till around that time.

- Once the UberEats mutipliers end in the evening, I head home. Typical hours for me is 11 AM to 3 PM for Honestbee, 6 PM to 10 PM for UberEats. 

For the whole day, I average between $50 to $80. Per week for tentatively three full days and one weekend night I take home around $200 in total.

&nbsp;

Of course, more importantly is to not try to maximise your per hour earnings by trying to complete your deliveries too fast. You will easily get tired and lose momentum for the whole day, and increase your chances of getting into an accident which will put you out of work for a long time. 

Pace yourself, what you earn in the long term is more important than what you earn in that one hour.",2017-09-07 19:29:09,73,,,/r/singapore/comments/6yl44i/any_ubereats_deliveroo_or_foodpanda_bicycle/

xarieongx,"Somebody else asked this before. Gonna copy and paste my comment here:

Worked Ubereats for 1.5 months. Living in Bedok but my friend and I chose Pasir Ris, better cause will only have to do deliveries in Pasir Ris.

(Pasir ris is just pasir ris in the Ubereats app, but bedok, kembangan, tampines, expo and simei is counted as 1 part)

Tried Bedok area on the first day and it was hell. Collect food from bedok mall, deliver to kembangan. Then collect food for another delivery at bedok mall again, deliver to Tampines. No point so Pasir Ris all the way for the rest of the 1.5 months.

Ubereats is count by total earnings for the trip x surge rate for that hour, so typically earn $10-16 per trip on sat/sun peak hour, $4-10 per trip on weekdays.

On a good day 3 orders an hour. There were a few times when my app was on for 8 hours, only got 1 order. Try to have the mindset whereby you work Ubereats more to exercise and earn extra cash, rather than to have a stable income.

Try not to work during non lunch/dinner timings. Very rarely get orders.

Make sure you get a phone mount, easier to accept orders and look at the map so you won't lose your way. DO BRING portable charger as well, cause the app is gonna be active the entire day to receive orders, which drains alot of battery.

The best perk about this job is that there will not be anyone bossing you around, it is OTOT so work anytime, rest anytime. 

TL;DR: Extremely unstable income, your earnings depends on if you get deliveries or not. Great for exercising and earning extra cash.",2017-09-07 20:33:48,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/6yl44i/any_ubereats_deliveroo_or_foodpanda_bicycle/

ImActuallyCarl,"It's been 3 month since I've worked with ubereats and I ride an electric scooter. The pay per hour depends on how fast you can deliver in that hour. Lets say on the weekdays 1 delivery I can earn about $5.74 and within that hour i can earn another $5.55 which total up to $10+ per hour. The problem i faced is that there are not many orders on the weekdays hence you might sit around doing nothing for the next hour . Even on the weekends , sometimes I sit around Nexx doing nothing for like 30 mins waiting for orders to come in. And there's incentive like when you finish 10 orders you can get earn extra money. Overall it's a fun job and the pay is every week so you won't go broke and you'll have the money to spend.",2017-10-15 01:05:06,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/76brl3/foodpanda_vs_ubereats_vs_deliveroo_riders/

uly2212,"deliveroo: 

entry - fairly straightforward: onboarding session online, after which you proceed to make appointment to fill out forms and get your gear. can be done in one single day. (note: $50 deposit for gear, returnable). You can choose your location then, but only one location is allowed and changing is very hard.

Operates on staff-o-matic app, there's an app provided so you can take up jobs and navigate to location etc. Bicycle/e-scooter VS motorcycle has different pay. Sign up for a slot on staff-o-matic, get to the place, turn on the app, and you're on.

Can't remember motorcycle pay, but bicycle is a base rate of $5 per hit with varying incentives based on various time periods and locations (greatest is weekend, evening, CBD). Motorcycle pay is more, but not that much more.

There's a tip box but people don't usually tip for a bicycle delivery since it takes quite long.

After filling forms and getting gear, you're practically free to do what you like when you like. I haven't done anything for the past 2 months since there's exams, and so far nothing's exploded.

Deliveroo: easy to sign up, no immense obligations. Prepare to earn at most 2 hits an hour if you're a bicycle guy. 

That's deliveroo as a bicycle rider in SG Sengkang/Punggol. I'm not sure about the rest. Hope this helps. You're better off doing part-times tbh unless you want to exercise at the same time, to which my thighs say this is great and my knee joints disagree.

Varantain,"Deliveroo > Grab > Foodpanda.

I had a problem last month with one of my vouchers — every time I email in (since live chat only works if there's an order placed), I get someone else, and I would have to explain my issue again. One CSO even gave me a voucher code that expired _two weeks before_ my email.

I believe their Facebook page is manned by more competent people (but still facepalm-level). You can try posting a comment to one of their posts, and hopefully they'll ask for your ticket number and take a look at it.

My issue hasn't been resolved, but I pretty much gave up. Some of Foodpanda's promos are good, but their service recovery is a _huge_ waste of time if things go wrong.

> All of the refunds is due to them double charging me which btw the first few agents vehemently denied i was double charged until i showed my bank statements. Only then did the agreed but instead of doing a lump sum refund they have been slowly processing each individual refund and everytime i bring this up their CS agents will be like “don’t worry you’ll get your money back ❤️” siao.

File a dispute with your bank. Double-charging is a valid reason within Visa/Mastercard to file a dispute.

1. Ordered pizza in with colleagues, and despite the restaurant saying that our order was ready, the rider never turned up. Since it was near enough, my boss drove out and collected it instead. Rider never ever showed up.
2. A couple of years, later, thought they might have improved and gave them a second chance. Ordered in pizza (again!), got a call from the restaurant directly to ask me if I wanted to change an item which was OOS, which I did. Food came, I thanked the rider and thought wow, they are ok this time round, only to discover a missing item (not the aforementioned earlier).

This is one of those dishes that I don't enjoy without the chilli.  
To me, eating minced meat noodles with no chilli is like eating steak well done without any salt, pepper or sauces.

Anyways, first order: no chilli.

Called up foodpanda CS and offered to make a second order immediately just so that they can bring the second order with enough chilli for both orders.

foodpanda CS assured me that he will make sure the next order went well but terminates the chat as I was making the order.

Food came with no chilli again. I rejected the order.

foodpanda CS refuses to refund either of my orders.

Only after unleashing my inner Ken did I get $10 vouchers.

I found out later that the foodpanda rider gave the second order to the security guard.

How did Deliveroo handle this similar situation?

The Deliveroo CS told me where I could find the restaurant's contact number and advised me to contact the restaurant if I have any dietary requirements.

No issues with my orders ever since.

Mee siam mai hum?

No problem, just call the restaurant, tell the restaurant my order number and my request.

EDIT:  
Why the downvote? 

It's not like I asked foodpanda to just deliver the chilli in itself.   
I offered and actually ordered the 2nd set just so that they can rectify the mistake.

Dear,

Thank you for choosing foodpanda.

foodpanda doesn't settle for anything short of perfection when it comes to delivering satisfaction to customers like you, so such a mistake is not something we can look past. I am sorry to hear that your cooking instructions for order gxxo-2xx1 with Cold Stone Creamery (The Gardens Mall) was not followed.

This is indeed not the type of experience we strive for. There can be unusual situations, which are contrary to the expectations. We hope that your next experience with us would be a good one.

We don't like average. We will get better. Promise!

For further inquiries, please feel free to reach out to us via Help Center. You can count on us 24/7.

We love our customers and would like to see you back soon. 🐼❤️

Thank you and have a great time ahead!",2020-09-01 23:49:22,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/

I tried to fight for that because its pointless to do the 2 dollars refund if they are going to charge me 4.5... she refused so hard and I feel like im just wasting my time so I just hang up... I dont think its worth another 30 minutes just to even fight for that amount...

Ansheilm,"Ken. Not Karen. 

But let me get this straight.

foopanda provide a special request but customer cannot use it?

Minced meat noodles usually have the option of sambal chilli and vinegar but now the customer cannot ask for it?  
Btw, they updated the menu to have those options now so I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one requesting for it. 

foodpanda did not keep their word and I can't oppose that?  
If I cannot ask for the sambal chilli, foodpanda should just say it upright instead of agreeing for me to make the second order and promising that it will be righted.

foodpanda rider gave the rejected food away instead of reporting it as a rejected order and that's ok?",2020-08-25 00:32:13,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/

Ansheilm,"Alright, how do I to talk to the rider directly?

All I could do was use the rider chat, but the rider showed me that he did not get any message at all.   
Another rider who delivers to my area later told me their app sucks ass and that the message generally only appears when they reach the customer.

Yeah, the vendor is the problem, but so is the foodpanda CS. 

Can, say can. Cannot, say cannot. 

Don't promise something then don't deliver.  
And the foodpanda CS definitely has the ability to contact the rider and tell him to double check on the order before leaving the vendor.

I would've stopped at the 1st order if the foodpanda CS is just upfront about it.",2020-08-25 15:34:06,0,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/
ThatBurnerAcc,"A rider who says he can't see the message, is either lying or the facing some app problems.

When you order something thru the FP app, you can press the chat to message the rider. The rider HAS to reply a customer message before he can proceed with anything (pressing pick up/seeing address/pressing delivered)

In doing so, you will also be able to see the Rider's name from your notification bar.

IF rider decides to play punk, you have your order number and riders name.

Customers aren't the only one facing customer support issues. Us riders have our fair share of problems from Cx, vendor and support.",2020-08-25 15:41:03,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/
Cylencer,"Am a foodpanda rider, can also confirm that the app sucks ass. Sometimes when I get a message notification from the customer, and once I open it, it will disconnect itself and I can't open the chat window anymore. The only clue is the brief heads up notification that I saw before tapping it, but I won't know the full message. Feedback countless times but nothing changed. 

So don't rely too much on the rider chat. If you want a foolproof way to get your message across to the rider, before you place your order, add it in the ""notes to rider"" in your address section. It will definitely show up on our app. But remember to clear it for the future orders. 

Also, don't bother with the CS, they are all outsourced to Pakistan now, probably. And they always like to end the chat before addressing concerns.",2020-08-25 15:52:16,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/ifoxp0/foodpanda_customer_service/

jupiter1_,"My 2 cents on this...
I think their logarithm is too smart.

It displays the restaurant that 1) can allow them to earn the highest commission fee first, then subsequently I believe they sort it by 2) popularity

So I assume the logarithm groups high potential restaurants (those that many will order and can allow for stack orders) so one driver can come and do the stacked orders at one go.

Whereas maybe OP restaurant is less popular and therefore is not even displayed. Probably they want to channel all possible riders to do stacked orders as compared to using one rider for one order which isn't efficient.",2020-06-06 03:20:44,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/gx3fxt/i_wonder_if_this_happens_in_singapore_a/

MrFantasticallyNerdy,"You're describing a systematic issue though. Businesses can only be if there are funds for them, and funds can only be if holders of such funds are willing to accept compromises on returns. The world we live in mostly doesn't work like that, even if there are a few that do. I like to cite Patagonia as one of the exception, not because I prefer their products (even if they are excellent), but because the company is built on a foundation that is balanced (between business growth, earth-friendly, and employee-friendly) in a way I like and appreciate. Even conscientious investors and company officials have to balance between what is ""unethical"" versus having enough to actually make the company work.

Don't believe me? If you have any money in stocks at all, do you know what the companies that you partially own do, and where they draw the line in terms of what is price gouging? If you can't answer that question, you may begin to understand the disjoint the current financial system has, and you may begin to appreciate that you are actually part of the problem. Heck, even if you don't own stocks, do you actually know what kind of company you're doing business with as a consumer? Like Amazon, and Alibaba? Have you considered that you are unintentionally supporting the status quo that you are railing against?",2020-06-06 03:21:47,-1,,,/r/singapore/comments/gx3fxt/i_wonder_if_this_happens_in_singapore_a/

SuperGira27,"Well, I worked foodpanda for awhile. The reason for the prolonged estimated time is due to the system prompting us to select the time the restaurant will take to prepare the food. The max we can select is 20min. Sometimes, there’s a really long queue at the restaurant and some restaurant prioritise walk-in customers. The waiter always tell the riders to wait when the riders tried to rush them. It can be annoying to many riders as it’s their main source of income and waiting means they are wasting their time and not earning any money. 

As a customer, I can also understand that it can be annoying to wait such a long time with an empty stomach. Especially when the estimated time seems to be extending infinitely. Certainly, there are drawbacks in food delivery that’s why I prefer to get the food personally myself.

executeorder69,"I did foodpanda delivery as a cyclist for a day. I was posted to the East office.

You take orders using your phone so you'd need a phone with good battery. You'll want to take plenty of water and be prepared to snack alot because you're gonna burn out quick. 

Orders were damn shag. You have to report to the office at the start of your shift, to sign in and collect your bag. Then off you go. Order are everywhere. I cycled from Paya Lebar > Aljunied > Paya > Aljunied > Paya > Tai Seng > Paya > Eunos > Kembangan > Bedok Reservoir > Paya. I actually took the MRT home from Bedok because I was so tired and couldn't be arsed to cycle to Paya then back home. 

Think now it's a little better. You can keep the bag so you don't need to report back. 

Pay wise it's better than retail and F&B jobs. Just hope your bike doesn't fuck up or shit like that so you don't need to spend more. Think it was like base $6 + $2 every order your complete (docket). I averaged 2.5 dockets every hour so $11/h for me. 

Go ahead if you want to exercise a ton. It's gonna feel super tiring and you have to wear their long sleeve shirt and long pants + covered shoes. It's good for people who don't want to work with others because you'll be alone.  Also, be safe, please be safe.

(Pasir ris is just pasir ris in the Ubereats app, but bedok, kembangan, tampines, expo and simei is counted as 1 part)

Tried Bedok area on the first day and it was hell. Collect food from bedok mall, deliver to kembangan. Then collect food for another delivery at bedok mall again, deliver to Tampines. No point so Pasir Ris all the way for the rest of the 1.5 months.

Ubereats is count by total earnings for the trip x surge rate for that hour, so typically earn $10-16 per trip on sat/sun peak hour, $4-10 per trip on weekdays.

On a good day 3 orders an hour. There were a few times when my app was on for 8 hours, only got 1 order. Try to have the mindset whereby you work Ubereats more to exercise and earn extra cash, rather than to have a stable income.

Try not to work during non lunch/dinner timings. Very rarely get orders.

Make sure you get a phone mount, easier to accept orders and look at the map so you won't lose your way. DO BRING portable charger as well, cause the app is gonna be active the entire day to receive orders, which drains alot of battery.

But I can somewhat see Grab perspective. Maximise profits while they are making losses elsewhere. As I understand, their cashcow is more towards food delivery compared to ridehailing.

Just open the app: Food, Mart, Delivery, Insurance, Gift Cards, Subscription, Tickets, Videos, Hotels, and, yes, transport. Cashless payment and a whole grassroots banking system that wants to replace fiat. Social media features and friends messaging. A live blog. Marketing offers from third parties that buy advertising space on the app. It’s a crowded, illegible mess, that exceeds the use case of 99% of its customers.

Its historical core mission (taken over from Uber) is matching the supply and demand for private transport on the island. There’s a legitimate case for the platform being agnostic of *what* is being transported -i.e. it may cater equally to food bags, parcels, or passengers- but it should just focus on serving that purpose *exceptionally* well. That means smart dynamic pricing algorithms, a responsive UI, precise geolocation and routing, an app that learns the travel habits of its customers really well, an awesome matching system, etc.

Instead, it has fallen into the habitual trap of an egomaniac and grandiose vision for a “lifestyle app” that has to be and do everything for everyone. As a result, it does each thing poorly, hurting customer service for both users and delivery partners.

wildflowersgrow,"Biting the bullet to go against the general sentiment of this thread... 

But like another poster mentioned, I believe we've got to understand the bigger picture of how Grab is doing. 

For a long time now, they've been rolling out their food delivery subscription service (it used to be $8 for a $5 & $10 voucher + free 30 deliveries with no minimum cost; think it's now $10 for the same amount for vouchers, but 50 deliveries and $10 min cost - pardon me if I'm mistaken, gave up that habit of grabfooding a while back).

I used to be some of those dudes who would order a $6 meal (I knew a friend who would order a $3.50 bubble teas) and get free delivery. Since Grab pays roughly $6 or more to its riders, and still has to pay the hawker/restaurant, you can imagine the loss they must have incurred during this period of time. 

I believe the main reason behind this move was to take away market share from the other food delivery services like FoodPanda and Deliveroo, by undercutting their profits (most likely taking a loss like what happened with Uber).

So #1 we learnt that Grab's food delivery arm in the Singapore context has probably been incurring losses. 

And #2 is even if food deliveries see a spike, we must be reminded that Grab as a whole is doing poorly in this period of time. 

I've got a friend who's a driver there and boy, there are legit no passengers at all. And that means less profits for Grab too, in the area in which they rely on most.

In response to this, they've allowed drivers to too deliver food, which in turn increases the supply of people delivering food, and as you've mentioned... Supply & demand. 

So yeah, I believe these wage reducing measures were already bound to happen, and the current covid crisis might have simply expedited the process. 

PS. not a grab staff. Actually do not like Grab (felt their price cutting measures were too mean for my lack of business acumen mind) as I used to ride for food panda but I thought an objective opinion should be shared.

embracingthesun,"i really think it’s high time Singapore does something to revamp the entire food delivery system. we are so far behind compared to China (I’m not being biased or bootlicking, it comes from experience because I am studying in Shanghai). in China, there are 2 apps available: eleme 饿了么 and meituan 美团, and taking out food using these apps is considered the norm. delivery is cheap and fast and there is a wide variety of food available, with frequent discounts and membership offers. the differences between how SG and China operate the system are probably due to the fact that our deliverymen are not as mobile compared to Chinese ones, Chinese riders usually use large e-scooters we call 电瓶车 which is like an electronic motorbike but far more convenient and speedy. given that our traffic conditions don’t allow for proper bike lanes and such e-scooters are quite dangerous, the speed of our deliverymen gets affected. also we just don’t have so many riders compared to China. 

and while supermarket delivery is the norm in China, the apps also offer medicine/flowers/immediate parcel delivery services. i think there’s so much more to be learnt and revamped on the sg side, it shocks me to see that all the problems still exist till now even though Grab, Deliveroo and foodpanda have been here for some time alr. i get that the situation in both countries definitely differ, but i still gape at the exorbitant price that doesn’t translate to riders’ wages and smooth wide coverage of services.",2020-04-06 08:09:56,11,,,/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/a_rant_on_grabfood/

XNights,"Tried grabfood as a mirco time job between uni, its OTOT nature was pretty good for me, started in July, felt like during that time it was pretty fair, but as time goes on I've noticed incentives were completely dropped or halved.

Their driver support is 50/50, sometime you luck out get the support/compensation you need,  sometimes they tell you tough luck. 

Their payout, I guess on weekends are decent, above the standard $10/H ranging about $15 onwards but it has been reduced every few months I noticed, another draw back is your work hours is limited to when people are looking for food (lunch/dinner). 

I agree it's not the nicest job to have, but I'm of the opinion it shouldn't be your full time job, just something to earn some change while looking for a job or while schooling.

Growing revenue without positive unit economics is still acceptable is a good economy (banks are willing to lend and money can be raised by showing growth).

The adjustments are just Grab trying to make the unit economics less negative, reducing the burn rate.

yeeez1,"Hi everyone, thanks for all the responses! Very heartened to see the care for our rider community. I'll address some of the more popular queries here:

- Who treats their partners better?

I have accounts with Grabfood and Deliveroo, and my close friend works for Foodpanda, so here's what I know:

Foodpanda - Fixed rate for deliveries, and the rate is quite fair (not the highest though) considering that your rider doesn't know your address until they've picked up your food (similar to Uber back in those days) - can be a good thing, can be a bad thing. But foodpanda dispatch is atrocious - if you thought their customer-facing support channels were bad, wait till you see their rider support. My friend had a job cancelled a week ago by accident after calling rider support to ask for cash reimbursement (customer made a cash order but noshow). Rider support still hasn't reimbursed him the trip fare or the cash portion of the food. Their tiering system also pits riders against each other - highest tier riders get paid more and can book slots early.

Deliveroo - By far the best company, if only they had better demand. Trips are more fairly compensated (they add our journey to the restaurant as part of the fare, Grab doesn't pay for distance to restaurant). Rider support is generally more friendly and knows what's going on. Policies are more reasonable. But their demand is trash - where I live, I can turn on Deliveroo for an entire day and get crickets.

Grab - Their flexibility is a huge bonus compared to the other 2. Things used to be good, getting worse by the day. One more incident comes to mind - they tried to get unsuspecting riders to ""upgrade"" their cash wallet, and when those riders cashed out, their earnings went into their Grabpay account (the one on the consumer app), not their bank account. Just like that, hard-earned money stuck with Grab. Absolutely scummy move in my opinion

- On Grab's balance sheet issues.

No doubt Grab is still making losses, but that isn't really my point. For a company that keeps putting out PR on helping partners and the community and all, I'm surprised they never thought about the optics of cutting rider pay during this time. If this was done any other time (pre-Covid), I don't think it would be such a problem. But in a time when Grab is actively trying to champion riders and drivers as ""essential to our community"" their act of lowering pay sure runs against that messaging.

It's telling to know that I'm not the only rider/driver/employee under Grab who feels this way. Hopefully they'll do something about it eventually.

Keep the comments coming, and stay safe y'all!

EDIT: If you're comfortable going out to dabao, do consider paying your neighborhood hawkers a visit! Buying directly from them means they earn more (cos no need to pay delivery commissions).

suffian87,"Being a Grab driver, I’ve understood so well how they work. Their PR is always to benefit the community. Their tactic is always to throw money to lowball their competitors away. When given the chance to monopolise, the first group of ppl to cut is their drivers. In this case riders. Once upon a time, drivers pay 20% commissions to drivers. But suddenly, if u pick and choose, drivers need to pay 30%. Do again, pay 40%. It was the biggest outcry done by drivers. Cos it goes against the concept of us being their partners. We do the job, we pay 20%. That should be it. This is veering towards modern slavery. 

After that feeble attempt and also me being banned on their platform, they reversed on that change. And can you believe it, I was banned for being vocal about it. So for riders, it’s simple, stop supporting grab. Those ordering food, stop ordering from grab. 

Now, here’s the next problem. Ppl need money. Some don’t care about all these principles. Though some riders will stop using grab, many others will still do it. And that’s why grab will still keep on growing bigger and bigger. Cut the pay, and still ppl do. Kpk, still got ppl do. They learn from their experiences in dealing with Singapore drivers. That’s why they make subtle changes. This won’t be the end. It will keep changing to benefit them until they can make money off riders and their customers. And that’s their end games.

>Commission Fees from merchants on GrabFood  
As far as we know, there have been no plans to increase commission fees during this period. We would appreciate it if you could let us know the name of the merchant so that we can take a look and check internally on this.  
  
>  
>Platform Fee:  
We made the announcement on the 12th of March, through an in-app message under the subject title ‘Service fees for GrabFood deliveries’. The feature is currently being rolled out to all users progressively.  
  
>  
>About that Reddit thread about GrabFood:  
Allow us to clarify that we did not cut the base fare for our delivery-partners. What happened to the delivery-partners over the weekend was a bug that has since been fixed on Saturday evening. As of writing, all the deliver-partners have been compensated accordingly for their work.  
Grocery Vouchers deducted from driver-partners wallet  
There was no secret deduction of any sort. What you and your reader have described is the Shop Now Pay Later programme that we rolled out to some of our driver-partners. This is a voucher financing scheme that lets our driver-partners purchase grocery vouchers upfront from us which they can repay over 13 weeks. This mechanic was made clear to driver-partners when they chose to opt-in for the programme.  
  
>  
>Tipping for driver-partners

If you do wish to clarify anything else, you can let us know over here or drop us a PM via Facebook where we are based. Thank you! - Heather",2020-04-09 11:35:26,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/a_rant_on_grabfood/

tehokosong,"Question for OP:'

* Without incentives/ reduction of distances will you still consider delivering food w/ GF?

* Has any restaurant partner shared if their comm structure have decreased due to Covid?

* Has the increased distance of delivery affected your earnings eg: before distance increase u earn $X per week on average, now u earn $Y on average

Considering right now 3 low level moving parts in this business (GF):

* Rider (No issue on supply, if you don't want to do someone else will based on current market conditions)
* Restaurant (Business heavily impacted due to takeaway only, earnings 50% or even lower currently before 7/4 dine in ban)
* Customer (Increasing in order, ideally order volume grows in tandem to supply growth for motor vehicles)

The platform will definitely try its best not to ""temp offline"" due to supply shortages as it impacts restaurants ability to receive orders and further impact their earnings, which results in less money from commissions to sustain it's supply base.

Currently out of the 3 parts mentioned above, riders have the most bandwidth in terms of stretching to ensure sustainability of the food delivery ecosystem in which many restaurants will be forced to shut down earlier if pressure is not alleviated on their end.

* Platform needs to be sustainable for restaurants to get orders
* Restaurants as of today Definitely need orders/ delivery else no need for riders or platform if it goes belly up
* Riders are the commodity needed to deliver the food

Sucks that riders get the short end of the stick here, but as consumers have you ordered from D'Roo/ Foodpanda? Competition only occurs when customers allow it to happen by supporting the other players in the market.",2020-04-06 10:06:42,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/a_rant_on_grabfood/

Grendalynx,"Basically this. 

Similar to many businesses, companies are cutting costs on areas that generate the main bulk of revenue on them, whether be it reduced/same/increased levels of profit so that they can use it to cover for the ailing side of the business. 

An example would be a hotel my friend is working at. He works at the bar in the hotel. Business is booming since covid, but due to the hotel occupancy rate taking a huge hit; they cut their part timers off even though the number of customers coming in has increased. It’s the same for grab, when I converse with the drivers once in a while, they told me that they are barely covering the costs of car rental, let alone making ends meet even before the circuit breaker.

Also, they realised that even with the increase in demand in orders, they can cut the earnings from their riders simply because too many people just want to get a job at this point with low demands from them.

The combination of both would mean that there’s no reason why any businesses facing this would not act the same way as Grab, especially when they operate under the venture capitalist model.",2020-04-06 08:08:24,26,,,/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/a_rant_on_grabfood/

yeeez1,"Ok fine, if Grab wants to play this game:

- Base fees:

Yes they absolutely decreased base fees. Any rider who's been working for at least a month can attest to that. Notwithstanding the fact that there was a glitch in fares on Saturday, every rider here has concrete proof that fares have dropped - on my side, I have a 0.98km trip which I completed on 23 Mar - I was paid $4.80 for that delivery. I completed another delivery on 5 Apr which was 1.04km, and I was paid $4.70 for that trip. Both trips happened in the same zone, starting from the exact same merchant. I don't know what Grab's definition of ""cut the base fare"" is, but any primary schooler can tell you that $4.80 > $4.70, and 0.98km < 1.04km - essentially, I travelled a longer distance and got paid less. If you're interested to see the screenshots of the 2 trips, drop me a PM and I'll be more than happy to share it with you.

I can't believe Grab is still trying to lie to people when we riders have black and white proof that fares have dropped.

EDIT - more evidence: I did a trip on 1.21km trip on 21 Mar for $4.90. On Tuesday (7 Apr), I did a 1.41km trip for $4.70. Today (9 Apr), I did a 1.52km trip for $4.80. P sure that's also a drop.",2020-04-09 19:57:54,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/a_rant_on_grabfood/
nicktanisok,"Not OP, but am part time/weekend grab cyclist for grabfood.

*- Without incentives/ reduction of distances will you still consider delivering food w/ GF?*

Unfortunately yes, because it is tough to find a job that grants this amount of flexiblity. The pay is not the best - but incentives really pushed you to do more orders and distances being >4km is a major gripe for me. Fucked up my knees doing all those uphill end of the world orders. 

- *Has any restaurant partner shared if their comm structure have decreased due to Covid?*

No contact with restaurant partners - communications and price setting between them and grab I believe are on an individual agreement basis. Someone more informed can correct me.

- *Has the increased distance of delivery affected your earnings eg: before distance increase u earn $X per week on average, now u earn $Y on average*

Yes, on average the payout is about 10 dollars lesser a day. (short) Orders that used to pay a minimum of 5 now pay about 4.5. (long) Orders that used to pay ~6.5 now pay about 5.9/6. This multiplied by 12 and reduction of incentives ($10 for 12 deliveries) makes us lose about ~$20 a day from the changes. Imagine working full time, this is significant (20*30 assuming working whole month at *minimum* orders is 600 dollars dip in earnings.",2020-04-06 11:22:36,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/a_rant_on_grabfood/

1. Incentives make up a large part of our pay (I'd daresay more than 30% based on my earnings), so if Grab completely removes incentives without raising base pay, I suspect there'll be a exodus of riders. As for distance reductions, it's really a suck thumb thing for us - damned if we do (customer complain food cold), damned if we don't (incentives affected).

2. I haven't heard any restaurant mention decreased comms.

3. Because our incentives are for per delivery, if I have to travel longer and take longer for each delivery, pay will definitely drop because the increase in base pay from the distance can never cover for the decreased incentive payout.",2020-04-06 11:16:54,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/a_rant_on_grabfood/

Grendalynx,"The thing is, in the instance for Grab, hailing services generate the main bulk of their income. Of course they do cut as much costs they can from it, but there is a limit to how much you can cut, and given the current situation in Singapore, they are still facing losses/massive losses. To mitigate some of the losses, there’s where food delivery comes in.

Right now, they are not at a stage where they can aggressively expand market share due to losses incurred. Given the current situation, maintaining status quo on the customer side, given the increasing reliance on food delivery would mean they are generating more revenue without the need to do anything at all. Thus comes cost cutting.

When they decide to lower incentives and potential income for riders, would it mean that they would face a shortage in riders? With the current job situation in Singapore, many people are swarming into transport(grab, taxi) and food delivery sectors. However, the current group of transport drivers are barely covering costs in the first place, thus Grab has stopped accepting new Grab drivers, let alone people not even wanting to enter the industry due to minimal income/potential losses, thus most people are trying to enter food delivery now. Even with reduced incentives, there are more potential riders available right now. Thus they can afford to save costs, yet be able to retain enough riders to cope with increased demand. Thus it would be a sensible approach to cut costs in the area they are profiting from since it won’t/will barely cause any drop in revenue at all.",2020-04-06 10:41:56,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/fvgcu3/a_rant_on_grabfood/

Master_McKnowledge,"Every single business out there wants to grow. There’s nothing wrong about that. There’s however something wrong about uncontrollable, aimless growth for the sake of growing. A business built on that pure objective is not sustainable. 

Back to the topic of Grab - it’s now trying to make the transition from growing business to sustaining business. Actually, I would even classify it as being past it’s initial growth stage. It’s got a very attractive business and user base, is pretty much unrivalled on the Singapore market... but they’re struggling to find that balance. Investors aren’t going to pour in money to help them secure “growth” anymore, and they sure as hell won’t keep pouring money in to sustain a bleeding business. Then you also hear of this sort of stakeholder unhappiness, and if you don’t have your delivery drivers and so on, that’s it.

They fucked their partners up with lower base fees. The average job is much less than $5/delivery now. 

They squeeze in stacked orders so you effectively get even lesser collecting and delivering 2 orders citing the deliveries are along the way (which in most cases are NOT! And to customers that are assigned last in the queue, good luck to you because if your rider gets stuck in a McD/BBT queue in between, you can wait forever for your quick fix order meal.) 

The incentives are harder to attain with higher standards and they recently came up with the silliest of team missions. I didn’t even bother to participate in it. 

They then misled the public with the stupid pizza pi chart in which they conveniently grouped the delivery fee into the pi, making it seem like the riders are taking over a quarter of the food order while they take less! The delivery fee is not supposed to be in the consideration of the pi chart.

And I don’t know why ST came up with reports of TOP riders earning 7k (deliveroo) and 5k (Grab) for March. I hope you guys still remember their stories of Grabdrivers earning 7-8k a month?! Ha ha ha.

distroyaar,"Yeah I experimented with all 3 food subscriptions over the past year and had previously chose Grab as it had the best variety. But over the past few months it's been getting worse in general, they keep finding new ways to fuck over customers and riders. I was only hanging on to the subscription in order to bleed their money dry since I can order 10+ times in a month. 

But now once my Grab subscription is cancelled I won't be going back. Food panda and especially Deliveroo just seem like better companies in general, have also made an effort to go direct to restaurants when possible.",2020-04-28 13:52:36,43,,,/r/singapore/comments/g9e9q1/grab_refutes_claims_it_quietly_stopped_popular/

In indonesia they still have cheap vouchers and subscriptions because of gojek as rival, however they too started to reduce the vouchers and subscription while taking high commission for food business.

It is just business. These kind of vouchers and subcriptions creates the illlusion that they had loyal customers which translates to growth so that they had excuses to their investors to inject more funds.

The only profitable service is their GrabFood, while their GrabBike and GrabCar bleeds, that is why they need to squeze more money for food delivery.",2020-04-28 19:17:48,0,,,/r/singapore/comments/g9e9q1/grab_refutes_claims_it_quietly_stopped_popular/

The-Darkest-Knight,"I'm a Deliveroo Plus subscriber, after the work from home situation started, I wanted to sign up for Grab's subscription too since they have pretty much all the restaurants that Deliveroo has, and so many more.

When I couldn't find it as an option, I called their Customer Care line, and asked them about not being able to see the Subscription. The person told me where to find it (like tap here and tap there) - I told them I know where it is, I don't see the GrabFood subscription. So then the representative said they'd send me a link, and using that I can get it.

The idiot in me was like, ""Oh wow, I've been a Platinum member for 2+ years, they're going to give me the subscription even though it's not available because I've given them so much business and they want to show appreciation.""

LOOOOOOOL

Obviously the link took me to the same page in the app with no subscription, and I called them back because I'm a stubborn asshole. Again the same thing, and this time they passed me off to a different rep, who said that it's been discontinued. When I asked why, all they'd say is that if it ever comes back, you'll know. That's it. It obviously isn't the person who made the decision, so no point arguing.

So much for all those bullshit, ""**We're here for you in these trying times**"" e-mails.

I'm glad I didn't cancel my Deliveroo Plus subscription. Delivery is free, and even though the choices of restaurants is a lot less, I'd much rather be their customer. I signed up when the subscription fee was $11/month. When Deliveroo changed it to $14 later, they kept the old customers on $11. No guesses for thinking what Grab would have done in the same situation. They would probably have charged an extra $3/month to make up for the lost revenue.

yeeez1,"As a deliveroo rider (converted from grab) I cannot tell you how glad I am to hear that restaurants also feel that Deliveroo is the best.

Deliveroo's system is really quite smart - they can guage when the order will be done, and only call a rider near the ready time. Most times when I arrive at the restaurant I see the food either fully packed or already fully prepped and being packed. Makes for much greater efficiency on the rider and the restaurant side, and much lesser arguments about waiting time (this was the reason why I made the switch - with Grab I spent more time sitting at restaurants than actually being on the road).",2020-06-22 00:23:43,9,,,/r/singapore/comments/hd1tk6/vent_grab_screwing_around_with_peoples_orders/

As someone who has been the GF rider, GF customer and worked in their call centre back when Grab dish out PROMO codes for free, I feel sad for the few Singaporeans who whole heartedly rely and support Grab. Everytime I go in the FB group dedicated to GF riders, I only see new videos being posted that sheds really bad impression of the riders or in general, Singaporeans. 

Touch your heart my dear GF riders, deep down you know Grab will never prioritise you in its business. Lol you are never their business partner, you are the slave worker who has to work under the hot sun and face off the brutal honesty that is the front line service. 
GF riders always fail to realise that their so called ricebowl will always be challenge and get eaten up by other competitors. 
Recently, it was the new GC drivers. Surge in new riders due to many losing their main income. Yet Grab keep pumping in more riders. Your incentives are gone (lowered). 
Now with more skewed perceptions by the public with recent sagas, do you really want to be loyal to Grab?

On a side note, yes I do still do GF once in a while. But no, if I want to cancel, I will cancel. Damn your AR or CR. No way in hells name will I wait for an hour for an order just because my incentives are on the line.

diceybubbles,"Could this be because Grab has alrd processed the payment and hence MUST fulfil the order?

The concept of a payment or transaction, is to exchange money for services rendered.

In situations like delivery, the transaction can only be completed by delayed fulfilment. And since payment has already been processed, GrabFood MUST fulfil their role (the reason for payment) which is to pass the order to the third party (BBT shop in this case) to fulfil, and upon that completion, pass to the GrabFood rider to deliver to the payer; thereby completing Grab’s end of the transaction.

Grab should have further control over every step to refund if cannot be completed at various stages, seemingly not built into their platform.

For completeness of argument and to provide my own counter thesis, I would also like to add that while we should all be kind to Grab and understand that such a situation may be unforeseen (we are in unprecedented times after all), this excuse is unacceptable for a company that can build surge pricing but not a way for third parties to manage their own incoming orders.

No, normal businesses aren't obliged to fulfill orders even if ""payment"" has been made — look at the [many cases of pricing mistakes](https://www.singaporelawblog.sg/blog/article/65).

Calling back grab to cancel the order that had food items that we were still trying to close, is very troublesome.

But the Grab partners, they had the option of not working with Grab. There's alternatives, or you can just not engage food delivery tech services.

The customers also want the luxury of not queuing, not going to buy food, and want these services at a cheap, affordable price. They don't want to wait too long too.

The grab delivery riders they want to earn income at their own time. They're afraid to cancel orders in fear of their ratings or whatnot.

Everyone is just trying to make a quick buck/live life. And as I've said, Grab probably isn't even profitable yet, especially in the GrabFood aspect. To me it just seems like people hating on other people, yet all are in the same sinking ship. 

Could Grab have an improved system? Yes. But are they purely at fault? If they didn't have a function for partners to not accept orders, couldn't the riders call it an early day or just cancel?

yeeez1,"Haha yeah I know lots of people get duped by the initial screen saying that they're finding a driver and restaurant is preparing your order - that's straight up false. Merchants don't receive an order until riders accept - I've tested this with multiple merchants when I stand at their counter, they don't see the order until I (as a rider) press accept, only then does their orange devide start ringing.

As a Deliveroo rider, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any food. But on Grab, waits above 10min are the norm rather than the exception.

As long as Grab cannot find a driver within 30min at all, they'll cancel your order without the merchant ever receiving said order. I guess it does have an upside - lesser food wastage from not being able to find someone to deliver. And as long as 1 rider has accepted and cancelled, the order will stay in the system forever and they'll find someone to deliver it.

Riders stick with Grabfood only because of flexibility and demand - Foodpanda riders need to book shifts (and get penalised for not attending them), Deliveroo just doesn't seem to be well know by consumers (super low demand on Deliveroo outside of town) and they're restricting hiring - right now Grab is the only one that's freeflow accepting applications, allows riders to online and offline as they please, and has demand from consumers.",2020-04-23 11:10:41,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/g60rs4/a_grabfood_riders_perspective_on_how_grab/

4. Customers' spending power (All these problems would disappear if customers was simply willing to pay more but how many can afford to?

tehokosong,"Actually from this equation, based on recurring manpower operating cost per stakeholder type:

1. Restaurant (Assume 10 person)
2. Rider (1 person)
3. Platform (Restaurant support, Rider support, Tech (app), Tech (infrastructure), Sales (to get new vendors), photography, restaurant logistics, marketplace management, Operations, Supply chain (for device and equipment), Finance (Billing), Marketing, Data team, Security team etc.

Breakdown of earnings:

1. Restaurant earns $17.55
2. Grab Driver earns $8 (Assume), lets be real, riders won't accept this order unless forced to do so due to the 8km distance, will be grabcar drivers.
3. Delivery app $22.7 - $8 = $14.7

Ultimately in this pricing structure all parties must be agreeable to the model. No one party really gives a shit as long as each other party is able to derive value to sustain their own needs.
  
Shit happens when profit structure prove unsustainable for any one party. Like i mentioned in an earlier post on another thread, riders are the expandable commodity in the current environment.

Restaurants main goal is to tide over this shitshow of Covid lockdown + explore inhouse / contracted delivery.

Platform main goal is to onboard as many restaurants as possible and ensure minimal problems in order assignment to riders/ fulfilment. 

Moral of the story: STAY THE FUCK HOME BECAUSE

1. Restaurants can earn 100% of the profit pie once this situation becomes better to allow walk-ins
2. Grabfood drivers go back to Grabcar so riders get orders
3. Platform goes back to their normal operational levels

The customers have also taken issue with the high commission fee third party services charge restaurants, which they allege can be anywhere from 10 percent to 40 percent of each order.
The lawsuit alleges that these companies — including Seamless, which is owned by Grubhub, and Caviar, which is owned by DoorDash — place restaurants in a tough spot with the commission, and that restaurants in turn are forced to charge customers more to make up for those costs. The higher restaurant prices across the board then drive customers to use third-party services more and potentially drive business away from some restaurants, the lawsuit alleges.",2020-04-15 21:43:54,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/g1bb8s/fb_owner_on_the_maths_behind_food_delivery/

pannerin,"Food delivery apps provide a low bar of entry for riders. The apps do simplify the workflow of delivery. You can walk, kickscooter, cycle with an unpowered bike. To work directly with a f&b business, you have to have a minimum of an ebike and have some experience riding. 

Riders are now struggling to get enough orders from customers, and every day more riders come aboard. We need to support these out of work riders and order more from apps. 

Do order from local businesses near your place so riders can have a quick delivery. We're too poor to order food, so idk how to save costs. But you can sign up for multiple accounts in your household to get the various forms of discounted delivery once you run out. Ordering (slightly) before and after peak periods would let riders earn for more hours, reduce their waiting time and the stall's prep time. 

Grab's food delivery service is now subsidising its transport services. Foodpanda and deliveroo should take the lead and follow the example of its American counterparts who are at least doing something. This is their opportunity to gain marketshare against the dominant player. 

The minimum that can be done is deferring commission charges, which isn't ideal as restaurants still have to pay afterwards. Doordash is waiving commission fees for new to platform restaurants for 30 days and takeout fees for all restaurants, as well as halving commission fees for restaurants with 5 or less locations until the end of May. San Francisco is capping commission fees at 15% for the period of the emergency, which is the minimum that the government should enact.",2020-04-15 09:38:16,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/g1bb8s/fb_owner_on_the_maths_behind_food_delivery/

When you use Grab, you pay for massive overheads. You subsidize other parts of their “empire” that they want to price aggressively to gain market share. You fund their ubiquitous marketing. You pay for the dividends going to the shareholders.

With a non-profit, you could operate the same island-wide service at cost, pay all parties involved (lean back office staff, delivery drivers) a fair wage, and have not an extra penny in overhead (no marketing, no dividends, no ancillary business, etc). The cost to F&B outlets would be considerably less, and any surplus at the end of the year would be reinvested in improving the performance and lowering the cost-to-serve.

The only road to profitability is:

1. Complete market monopoly resulting in raising delivery fees for the customers or the merchants. This may not even be possible as new unprofitable disruptors will just join the market since barriers are low. 
2. Some other way to drastically reduce the cost of delivery: robot delivery or some crazy good route optimization.. but these are all still ages away and come with physical limitations.

My take is that delivery fees will shoot up eventually, and customers will just have to accept it. Either that or they all go bust and get replaced by some new start-up funded with deep pockets.",2020-04-15 14:43:10,12,,,/r/singapore/comments/g1bb8s/fb_owner_on_the_maths_behind_food_delivery/

Each delivery ride is costly especially for perishable goods like meals which have to be delivered in 30 min within ordering - this limits route optimization which often lowers cost.

If marginal costs are high and unit economics are fundamentally unprofitable, then scaling WORSENS the problem. Scale only helps if there are high fixed costs and low marginal costs. 

Maybe a complete monopoly may help but honestly I think they either need to have
- high minimum order size 
- high fixed delivery fee

Bryanlegend,"After factoring in petrol and rental (for some), most riders and Drivers earn somewhere between $8-10 per hour, which is equivalent to part time F&B pay. Furthermore, that amount earned is not a constant; you might be able to take home more than 10 bucks per hour during peak lunch hour, but during 3pm when there’s nobody ordering, you might even have to drive around without any order and income. 

Also, fees were never $2-3, not sure where you got that idea from. Your delivery fee might be that amount, but additional money is drawn from the commission Grab earns to supplement that amount to more than $6-7. No one in their right mind will drive a vehicle and spend an hour just to earn a few bucks. The petrol and parking fees will easily exceed that already.

Edit: I’m familiar with this line of work, and based on my dad’s experience (he’s a grab driver) you can take home maybe $90 per day for weekdays and $110 for weekends. And this is working close to 8-9 hours Everyday. And he still have to deduct rental and petrol which is about 40 bucks total per day.

Varantain,"> - UOB One card - gives you 5% if you spend SGD2,000/month for 3 consecutive months and 3.33% if you spend at least SGD500 for 3 consecutive months (but dealing with UOB is the most painful experience on the planet; this is a bank that will send you a SMS that they sent you a physical letter to ask you to send them an e-mail)

> - HSBC Advance - SGD150 on first SGD800 if you spend SGD800 in first month; 1.5% up to SGD70/month otherwise (2.5% if you are HSBC Advance client); 2.5% for dining, utility and telco bills with SGD2,000/month minimum spend (could be useful as a second card like the Amex True Cashback)

I don't recommend UOB One to most people, because they will _never_ achieve the maximum effective cashback rate of 3.33%/5% unless they track all their spend, and don't spend anything more on their card once they hit their desired tier.

HSBC Advance is probably the best cashback card for anyone that doesn't want to think too much — their Advance bank account isn't difficult to meet the criteria for to hit the 2.5% tier.

Note that it's also possible to redeem your rewards points as cashback — the rate is usually somewhere between 2% to 3% for any of the 10x points cards.",2020-06-15 04:09:10,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/h8rrr2/best_nonairmiles_cash_back_credit_card_in/

Varantain,"> 
I'm actually pretty confused by the Maybank Visa Infinite.

It's 3 points per dollar on all local spend, which is redeemable at a rate of $50 per 17,000 points.

That works out to around 0.88% cashback.

I just read the article in full — it seems possible that one of the reasons author Tan Ooi Boon recommended the Maybank Visa Infinite card, was because one of their interviewees was Karen Low of Maybank. She somehow managed to suggest that card in one of the last few paragraphs.

Pretty much every bank (and there aren't that many in Singapore) allows for their reward points or miles to be redeemed as cash — the rate tends to be very bad.

For example, [DBS](https://rewards.dbs.com/Index.aspx?id=8) allows one to redeem $10 credit with 1,200 points. With an accelerated online spend card like DBS Women's World Mastercard (2 points per dollar of online spend), that would work out to 1.66% cashback on online transactions. The higher redemption tiers offer better rates, but most people end up redeeming those points as airline miles.

[UOB](https://pib.uob.com.sg/Rewards/), similarly, allows one to redeem $20 cash with 2,000 points. With an online spend card like the Preferred Platinum Visa, that would work out to effectively 2% cashback. (There's also $100 for 8,700 points, which works out to 2.29%.) Their PRVI cards would work out to a 0.8% cashback rate on all local spend — almost comparable to Maybank's Visa Infinite.

So while the Maybank Visa Infinite might be above average to redeem points to cash, I'd still consider that ST article quite shoddily researched.

(Source: I have an obsessive interest in trying to min-max spend.)",2020-06-15 04:07:38,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/h8rrr2/best_nonairmiles_cash_back_credit_card_in/
Varantain,"> First, a lot of people can surely consistently spend at least SGD500 or 1,000/month to hit the 3.33% cashback for the UOB One.

I guess it helps if one has bills to pay, or a substantial grocery budget for a family. And can spend the same amount over 3 months.

> I definitely tracked my big purchases to make sure I maximised that card and stopped when I hit the cap.

I do this too, but most people I discuss cards with mostly just want _one_ (maybe _two_) card(s) where they'll get ""the best"" rewards for their spend.

> Second, not sure why you would want to tie up SGD30,000 in a HSBC Advance bank account, make debit card transactions to qualify for the account etc.

One can just credit a salary/recurring deposit of $3,500 a month, and not maintain a balance.

planet__express,"There was once when I placed an order and the driver did not turn up to take the food. I called the restaurant directly, they said they'd been waiting an hour for the driver and they had been calling Foodpanda for the past hour, but FP kept telling them they'd send a new driver. In the end, the restaurant gave me the FP number to call directly.

I did so, and it was picked up within 3 rings by a live agent who sounded local. I could hear laughter and jokes in the background as I explained my issue. The agent turned hostile the moment I said I was a customer, and she said I wasn't supposed to have this number. I said the restaurant gave it to me because they didn't know what else to do, FP wasn't helping them.

The agent proceeded to inform her colleagues about this in another language, thinking I wouldn't understand her. (Joke's on her, I'm fluent in the language she's speaking). She then proceeds to say customers are all troublesome and a waste of their time, before keeping me on hold for 20 min. She finally came back to me and told me they would refund me.

I told her (in the language she'd used) that it's too bad customers are a waste of their time because we're the reason her company is in business. Cue uncomfortable silence before she pretended to be cut off and hung up on me.

I never got my $48 refund and I've never used Foodpanda since.

sourpower321,"Worked as a foodpanda cyclist for about 3 months after NS and here are my opinions on foodpanda.
The process for an order are in 3 phases 
1) accepting the order
2) collecting the order
3) delivering the order

We had 15 minutes to collect the order and 15 minutes to deliver. At every process there is always a problem. 

Before even accepting the order the 15 minute timer has already elapsed. The order is already allocated to a Rider, if I as a rider didn’t accept it because I haven’t completed my previous order or whatsoever, the algorithm will send it to another rider. Sometimes there aren’t enough riders , so the wait just continues.

When collecting the order, some places are extremely busy especially at zi char stores. These stores aren’t well equipped or have a system in place for delivery services. Usually they prioritize the customers physically at their store and so the wait continues. Once I waited 1hr for 2 packet of fried rice.

Delivering the order, it’s a matter of following the GPS and just cycling. The only possible fuck up here is if you put your address wrong. The only problem is usually condominiums, sometimes the security system is so fucking annoying requiring you to do 10000 steps and the customer never wants to collect the food from the guard house. And sometimes the security guard is a  cunt.",2019-05-06 18:54:33,43,,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/
Permanent_Secretary,"I don't think the problem is with the riders. A majority of people do not fault the riders, the ones that do are assholes. Period.

Foodpanda and their various competitors are the ones at fault here. Setting ridiculous timings for food to be delivered is really asking for complaints to be made. The poor riders, as the face of the deliveries, would eventually pay for this poor managerial decision. 

For example, if one were to go on Foodpanda and order a meal from a foodplace, the app would give an estimate timing of delivery (e.g 20mins). This thing is, the customer would assume that after paying for their food, it would be delivered in 20mins. This is not the case. Foodpanda would firstly have to allocate the rider for the job - this takes time. A lot of it. Meanwhile, the 20mins timer would have already start counting down.

If it takes 15mins for the rider to be allocated, the estimated timing should indicate 35mins, right? Well, Foodpanda does not seem to think so. I have seen this from Grab too. Suggestions to suspend food places does to not seem to be working effectively and efficently. (Only during peak periods, for what I have observed.)

The number 1 place where delivery is seemingly consistent, more often than not, and would always set a benchmark in the food delivery business is non other than Mcdelivery. 

The rest of the industry players really need to improve their delivery processes. The only good thing they have going for them is price.

Normally there’s a timer for every order you receive. Sometimes it’s 13 or 10 mins. Worst is when it’s like -5 mins. It’s probably an order which another rider rejected or something. 

But what’s even worst is when you’re early to pick up the food but the vendor takes like 30 mins to prepare it. Then because of them, we have to rush ourselves. 

A lot of the customers don’t complain when I send them late & I’m thankful.

So guys, sometimes the delivery rider is busy waiting at our counters for your order to be fully cooked & packed while the customers queuing up at our counters are competing for our time, focus & resources too. So this is something that is neither their or companies like FoodPanda's fault.

yesterday when I ordered Pizzas, I was thinking the same. Maybe, for food delivery guys they should have a different system. Normally, they ask him to add his details, the receiver's details, packet details, etc. Instead, they should take a picture of him and ask where he wants to go - the guy can deliver and later while returning he can provide the details. Or the security guard can collect his ID and allow him to deliver first (so the customer gets their food fast and hot, rider gets to reach there on time, and anyhow the details can be filled at security cabin).",2019-05-06 19:43:25,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/

I’ve ordered so many times from KFC and it’s always been later than the time given. I’ve tried emailing customer support but they never got back with why they set the timing so early. 

Agreed that McD is different vs Foodpanda and Grabfood, but the time allocated to find a rider should be added into the time given, maybe giving about a generous average time (~15 minutes or so during non-peak hours?) and the actual time food would be delivered. 

There’ll be people who would rather have early/on-time drivers, and hence trust that company more, than one who constantly has drivers not deliver the food ‘on time’ . And when word-of-mouth gets around, plus smart marketing, there’ll be people who switch over. Companies can appear more sympathetic and appreciative towards their drivers like this, which plays on people’s heartstrings and make them think “oh, that’s a company I’d support”.",2019-05-06 17:32:23,8,,,/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/

james_dykeson,">	It’s rather shortsighted to refuse to express slightly more care and consideration during this period.

Can you point out the part where I said that? 

I said that fasting for health or religious purposes must not be used as an excuse to reduce productivity at the expense of the business. 

Both the employer and employee could of course try to find ways around it (e.g providing snack/power bars to support riders who choose to work through dinnertime without breaking fast) - it is up to them to figure out a win-win solution.

Are clearing trays specifically part of a cleaner's jobs? If they are, of course the cleaners should do their jobs. 

If they are not, then I support raising civic consciousness to help keep hawker places tidy. But which is which?

chubbycheeks90,"Happened to me once. Ordered McDonalds. Everything goes as per normal within the time frame given. Order received, driver assigned, driver at the restaurant, driver is on the way, then order delivered. I thought, maybe the driver accidentally pressed the “delivered” button on his phone, so I waited 15 more minutes. Still no show. Call the driver, he picked up and said that it’s delivered and he has passed the food to somebody. 
Since I lived in condo, the security has to intercom me whenever there’s any visitor for my unit. So, I went down and asked the security, both the security guard said there’s no food delivery coming in on the last 30 mins. I was hangry. I ordered another food (still with GrabFood, what can I say, I like to collect points) and it arrive safely to me. I don’t even bother calling their customer service. I sent an email to them, they said they’ll investigate and 1 hour later give me a coupon code for $5 or $10 off (can’t rem) and fully refund back my McD purchase.

My guess is the driver ran away with my McD as it’s too tempting to resist. Or, maybe he’s just hungry.

oblivionraptor,"I think Foodpanda has the highest per docket pay among the three companies, but there's no distance incentive. E.g $6.50 per docket regardless of distance travelled. The more you work, the higher you rise through the batch ranking. Lowest is Batch 5. highest is Batch 1. It's like a game, but you grind it out in real life. You gotta have fast fingers if you wanna get your preferred shift timing, or else you'll have to either settle for unpopular slots (graveyard hours) or wait for someone to offer their slots. I do Foodpanda every now and then.

Grabfood, however, has the distance incentive. If I'm not wrong, $5 base per docket, and then you add in the distance and whatever bonus you have. This one can OTOT, but you can only cash out after you hit $50 earnings.

Deliveroo I have no idea, I don't have friends working with them. Should be the same as Grabfood.

You'll have to spend some amount of cash on buying their equipment, which is mandatory, so far I don't see anything regarding the use of second-hand equipment while working for them. I see people use unmarked and unbranded thermal bags, which goes against their guidelines. [Grab will penalize you if you're caught violating their equipment standards.](https://www.grab.com/sg/gfgear/) If you wanna use unbranded bags and not wear the delivery company uniform, at your own risk.

Anyway, I agree with what /u/zenqian has to say.

iStingerX,"If you are taking the public transport to somewhere for only a short while before going home, don’t take the same route back as it will count as two trips. Try to group it as one very long trip. 

Example A: I take MRT from Lakeside to One-north to meet a Carouseller. After dealing, take the bus from one-north to Buona Vista and take MRT back to lakeside. This will count as one long trip compared to two trips if you tap back in at one-north. Edit: I checked my transactions and the last time I did this it failed, possibly because the whole journey exceeded 2 hours as the bus took too long to come. This example requires confirmation. 

Example B: Near my house Bus 1 and 2 has slight overlaps in their routes and both can bring me to a shopping centre. If I take bus 1 to go shopping centre to buy food home, I will only take bus  2 back so that it counts as one trip. This only works for buses with different numbers, not alphabets (to the best of my knowledge).

Edit: there are certain conditions as many redditors pointed out. From transitlink website:

A transfer can be from:

the MRT/LRT to a bus service;
the MRT/LRT to another MRT/LRT;
a bus service to another bus service; or
a bus service to the MRT/LRT.

Under Distance Fares, the rules are:

-All journeys must be within 2 hours of the first boarding (on the same journey).

-Maximum of 5 transfers can be made within a journey.

-Multiple rail transfers allowed with no additional boarding charges.

-45 minutes for transfers between rail station and bus service, or between different bus services.

-15 minutes for transfers between different rail stations.

-Current bus service must not be the same number as the preceding bus service.

-No exit and re-entry at the same station.",2019-06-15 03:01:08,46,,,/r/singapore/comments/c0kku5/what_are_some_cheapskate_life_hacks_in_sg/

Tbh the Miniso wallets can last me about 8 months before peeling and it can be a good temporary wallet while you hunt for better quality ones.

Also, decent quality socks and ties can be found at Miniso and Daiso, and they can look professional/personalised enough for suits. 

Many items in Daiso are actually cheap and possibly useless, but they sell pens, kitchen knives, and other useful items at rates cheaper than Popular or Kitchenware shops. 

2. My mum bought almond nuts at the wholesale centre at Waterloo Street (Albert Food Ctr Level 2) for rates cheaper than Cold Storage/NTUC.

3. If you want cheap printing ($0.05 per page) you can try Polytechnic print shops (and for Universities I only know of SUSS/UniSIM adjacent to Ngee Ann Poly), the most I know they require is for you to register a wallet account at a booth (Republic Poly).

5. Slightly cheaper food can be found in Universities and Polytechnics (and the portions are definitely enough).

6. Sometimes a good phone case of ~$30 can save you repair fees or replacement fees that cost way more than that $30 'protection fee'.

Seeing today's downpour makes me think back on this. We already have ride-sharing and property-sharing (this one not in SG, but still), why not umbrella sharing? 


I understand that not every season will be raining, so revenue/usage will not be consistent throughout the year. Maybe it won't be a standalone service. Maybe deliveroo can give out umbrellas with the deliveroo branding to their whales/frequent users during rainy times? Then when these users finish using, can return to the next deliveroo person they meet.

tictactorz,"if you want to plan with friends, i hope it’s friends in your course lol. Check if you need to take specific courses in a semester. Actually most of the time (in my course at least), lectures are for everyone and tutorial slots varies but usually can just crash tutorial slots as long as attendance is taken. 

and no you shouldn’t plan all modules with friends. You can be independent and take modules that interest you. For instance if mod A is easy to you, it might not be to others and vice versa. Remember, you’re the one taking the mod and your grades will suffer if you choose to take something you are not interested in/cannot do. So don’t take mods just because your friends are taking. No need to FOMO. Make sure you know how many AUs you need in a year and plan accordingly. Extremely important to know what modules you have to read in the upcoming sem!! Then add them (the cores) to stars planner now under plan 1. 

for compulsory electives, add to stars planner under plan 2. Compulsory electives always got slot for you one so never mind. Cores are for plan 1 so you can immediately add to stars and win the system when it’s your time.

if you plan electives and cores in plan 1, you will waste time ranking the electives, so just add cores in plan 1!!",2018-06-01 20:18:36,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/8nmj9n/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

SwordLaker,"Sure it's a red flag to talk about exes while dating, but I personally think it's natural and could even be helpful to know about your partner's past in a long-term relationship. It's a sign of care for one, and two, it's insight into what kind of person your person once was, and therefore, who he/she is and will be.

But that's just me.

You do have a definite stand on the issue, and that would take a compatible partner to work with. Either he/she has to share a similar stand, or has to be emphatic enough to understand and respect a different opinion.

What you need to do right is to let him know your stand on the issue, that you don't see a point looking back to the past and he is the most serious partner you have had, in the clearest and most serious way possible.

If you do your best and his reaction isn't up to your expectation, then it's a red flag of incompatibility to more serious issue in the future. If this is actually the case, then the relationship should be re-evaluated (Are you having this relationship in the long-term or short term? Will this affect what you want to get out of the relationship? If yes, then what should you do?).

Perhaps he’s asking about yours to know how to make you happier but if he’s been talking about his ex’s to you, it sounds like he wants to hear about yours to make him feel like he’s a hero in your life. 

This is probably subjective based on what you’ve posted though. But yes do let him know you’re very uncomfortable with it.

Harbinger_Reaper,"Where are you having problems at? I’ll give general advice but it’d help if you state where the problems are at.

Breathing control during the rundown can help a lot. But no matter how painful chiong during the rundown. Literally. (Well, unless you feel like you really cannot tahan. But normal to feel damn shag during the rundown)

Also during the stages where not so much physical activity is involved slow down a bit to get your breath back. For example what I do is slow down at the dodging panels to avoid tiring out at the low rope. But still try to go fast. The first 5 obstacles can be time consuming. Once past the first 5 obstacles it’s more of balance over strength. So should keep moving, won’t be as hard as the first 5.

For Low rope itself I’m sure your commanders have drilled it into you already but it’s a matter of technique>strength. If it helps what you can do is use a pull up bar, mount and hang from it with both hands and just crunch your legs as high/close as possible and hold it there for about 5 secs, then slowly release.

Feel free to ask anything else! My best timing for SOC was 3:36! (Felt like shit afterwards haha)",2018-06-01 20:00:17,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/8nmj9n/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

negnit,"Happy Birthday :) 

Birthdays used to big a huge deal and kinda of a yardstick of how much my friends care about me, yet as I grow older with each birthday, I come to understand that people love in different ways and forgetting your birthday or not celebrating with you doesn’t mean they appreciate you being in their lives less.

I also understood that birthdays aren’t a huge deal to some people and it can be a painful day with terrible memories for a select few too. 

Yet, being upfront about how upset you are at your birthday being forgotten and the importance/ significance of birthdays to your close friends (after all, I assume that these are the people who are near the top of your priority list) is important because honesty and good communication is the foundation of all relationships :) 

This would also allow your close friends to know that you expect at least a birthday greeting or celebration together of sorts because they are your close friends and that spending this special day with them is something you hold dear.

,"I second East Coast area! It's a good mix of locals \(like me\) and expatriates, and has lots of F&B options \(many types of cuisines, including popular local food joints with perpetually long queues\) and amenities including two malls and a large sea\-side park. 

The vibe of East Coast tends to be quite laid\-back and the main East Coast Road area consists of rows of two/three storey Peranakan shop houses with a multitude of restaurants, bars, cafes & bakeries on the first level. I feel it's quite a different experience from the urban concrete jungle that covers most of Singapore.

After moving there, I hardly see the need to go to the central areas such as Orchard anymore. Moreover, prices of food and groceries \(there's still expat supermarkets so don't worry\) etc will be slightly cheaper than Orchard as well. Rent is also slightly cheaper than the city center and other expat areas so you could be getting a bigger\-sized condo unit for less. 

Seeing that OP is gonna work at Suntec, there's many direct buses \(197, 10, 14\) including peak hour express services that will bring OP from East Coast to Suntec in 30 mins or less!",2018-06-01 13:33:39,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/8nmj9n/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

Cut them some slack, they are still uni kids afterall. Not 5-10 years experienced hire. They are still learning how to work in a work environment. Heck, I'm sure for some of them it's their first internship or first time in a work environment.

Cutting down on the passive aggressiveness will certainly help everyone. Ask them: Are you sure you can remember all this? or just tell them straight up to take notes.

Not everyone has the initiative, but if you choose to keep silent, and then those kids come back to ~~(bite you)~~ ask you a gazillion questions, I can't say you weren't at fault too.

teestooshort,"> Also, do women in their 20s have high standards in SG in terms of who they date?

Sorry bro but Singapore women differs from each other so I would say it depends, some have high standards some have low standards but those that you meet at the club **probably** have little to no standards since **some** are looking for one night stand. So, just by being attractive will do. 


>I am just wondering if people in SG hook up in bars and public places or is it more reserved to work/school?


Once again, it depends, some Singaporeans fuck at the staircase, some in the club's toilet while others do it in private.",2018-06-01 15:47:03,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/8nmj9n/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/
gnoserif22,"Depends on the crowd/environment that you are trying to appeal to. If you're a corporate type, there's probably more chances as certain industries and companies \(MNCs\) tend to attract more liberal thinking types who are more open and responsive to just having a date to see how it goes, especially those that have a 'let's have drinks after work' type of culture.

If you expect to go up to a girl in a club and say ""Hey, can I buy you dinner sometime?"" it's probably not going to work. Our culture isn't much of the open approach type I'd say.",2018-06-01 15:49:37,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/8nmj9n/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/
Sproinkerino,"1) this is reddit, I'm not doxxing you I'm just reading your old posts. It's open for all to see. Unlike the other commentor I didn't link any of the posts. 

2) have you considered if asking such a question about people of another culture appropriate? 

3) if you haven't realized, most of the comments are referring to you last sentence. Not all women are superficial and base their relationship choices on looks.

Idk maybe in your culture it's fine but whatever you are asking or doing is weird to us.

khaosdd,"Eh isn't being in uni supposed to make u better prepared for work life? Or is the educational system faulty here?

Regardless, it's about taking notes. Did you only started taking notes when you begin working? What were you doing during lectures then?

Paggro as I may be, I feel it kinda shows the person attitude towards work. Ie. It's insignificant and / or not important enough for me to spend the time to write it down. Cause if I dont know, nvm la can always ask my mentor who is just sitting there waiting for me to ask him questions. :D (that's an /s at the back, btw)

Can there be any other reasons? If u say *""Oh I scared my mentor don't like""*, then your advice to open one's mouth applies to them as well, u don't need 5-10 years of experiences to do that. 

I'm ok to handhold you throughout the whole day and sacrifice my time by doing more OT every day as long as you learn or at least show that you make an effort to. But there should be a limit, especially when it's something you yourself should be a good judge of (ie. Whether you can remember all these stuff I'm gona tell u)

Nonetheless, different people different style. I'd had concurred with some of your points should it had been for other scenarios, just not for this specific case.

The fact that you squeezed yourself in the already packed train meant that you were ok with squeezing together with the people in the train.

If he were to remove his bag, in the event when the train jerks, there will be body to body contact.

This is the scenario where I do not agree with Bag down Benny.

Then again if it were the guy with the bulky bag who is boarding the train, he will have to remove his bag (rightfully so) cos he has to adapt to the people already present in the train.

,"1.  I came here just to ask a simple question about the dating scene because I thought it would be appropriate to ask the SG subreddit but apparently, I can't do that without people going through my reddit history and nitpicking one of my posts.  

2.  It is appropriate to ask people of other cultures questions like that if you are polite about it and are showing good intentions.  How else would you learn about a person you know nothing about about in real life?  You don't  look through their personal files.  


3.  I guess thats my fault for including those sentences into my original question because people are misinterpreting it for something really bad.  And of course, you can't generalize women just like you can't generalize men.  I said SG women are beautiful because I meant that as a compliment, not as something malicious.   As for my personal experience with that 1 person, it was 1 bad interaction that happened when I was very young (17  years old).   I'm not generalizing women based on that one experience.  Also, people get older and move on.  Thats how life goes.

icyfantasy,">Eh isn't being in uni supposed to make u better prepared for work life? Or is the educational system faulty here?

I hope so, I'm not there yet so I'm not in a position to comment on this, but it seems Singapore's education system is highly focused on academic pursuits, so I would say, *yes* it's faulty.

>Regardless, it's about taking notes. Did you only started taking notes when you begin working? What were you doing during lectures then?

Listening to the lecturer? Notes aren't devine words that magically make you ace an examination. You take them down when you *feel* there's a need or it's important. Maybe those interns of yours (incorrectly) felt that it's not important, then shouldn't you remind them to take down notes? Don't your lecturers ever remind you before?

>Paggro as I may be, I feel it kinda shows the person attitude towards work. Ie. It's insignificant and / or not important enough for me to spend the time to write it down. Cause if I dont know, nvm la can always ask my mentor who is just sitting there waiting for me to ask him questions. :D (that's an /s at the back, btw)

Or would you rather they not ask at all and fuck up? Maybe they also paiseh to ask but eventually built up the courage to? I'm not you so only you can answer these questions.

>Can there be any other reasons? If u say *""Oh I scared my mentor don't like""*, then your advice to open one's mouth applies to them as well, u don't need 5-10 years of experiences to do that. 

Why not just ask them? See, this is the kind of passive aggressiveness innate in every Singaporean. Got problem don't want ask but  speculate everything instead, then when problem come back to bite you then kpkb. Doesn't hurt to ask them: ""Hey, why aren't yall taking down notes when I was teaching y'all earlier? Am I being too fierce or anything? I noticed y'all come up to ask me about things I've already talked about earlier. It will be better for both of us if you took down notes when I'm teaching, then got anything unsure then ask me."" This isn't that hard isn't it?

>I'm ok to handhold you throughout the whole day and sacrifice my time by doing more OT every day as long as you learn or at least show that you make an effort to. But there should be a limit, especially when it's something you yourself should be a good judge of (ie. Whether you can remember all these stuff I'm gona tell u)

I agree that there should be a limit, but if you choose not to take action before it reaches that limit, shouldn't you share part of that blame too? 

>Nonetheless, different people different style. I'd had concurred with some of your points should it had been for other scenarios, just not for this specific case. 

The devil is in the details, maybe there are other things you are not telling us, maybe those interns are actually brain-dead and can't think for themselves, maybe you aren't as passive aggressive as I think you are. But hey, I'm just a stranger on the internet, do as you see fit to resolve this issue.",2018-06-01 17:45:57,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/8nmj9n/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/

-LifeOnHardMode-,"Generally, in e-commerce platforms, payment is not released to a seller until a transaction is completed. 

A non-registered parcel's delivery status cannot be tracked automatically. 

Some buyers do not update the status when they receive their parcels. 

So, it's wise for a platform to automatically progress a transaction to the next stage if no action is taken by the buyer after a generous waiting time. Otherwise, sellers have to keep bothering their buyers or the platform's staff to update the status in order to get their money. 

If a buyer has not received their item, but their order is going to be automatically marked as ""delivered"" soon, they should sort it out with the seller or seek help from the platform's staff. 

Deliveroo is not a good analogy here. They are more akin to registered mail as the platform can rely on the delivery man to update the status.",2019-01-31 05:16:02,2,,,/r/singapore/comments/alb4uk/wow_i_am_impressed_by_the_efficiency_not_lazada/

-LifeOnHardMode-,"I'm not sure if we are on the same page. 

Does deliveroo's app really automatically update a delivery status after a set timing? If so, that's a pretty bad design. They can get the deliveryman to update the status. 

Lazada can't get a deliveryman to update the status of a non-registered mail. The buyer is the only person who knows the status accurately in this case. However, it's not good to put the onus on the buyer to update the status. So, Lazada automatically progress the transaction to the next stage after a liberal estimate of the delivery time if no action is taken by the buyer. 

I do not know any platforms that rely on buyers to confirm delivery before settling payment to the sellers. As you have probably already figured out, that would be a bad design.

TnuldblunT,"No, Deliveroo's app doesn't auto update. Deliveroo doesn't require customer to confirm order to remit payment to seller. 

I do not see why it should be right for Lazada to assume that the job is done when it might be not. It is simply unprofessional to openly commit to creating false positives. 

So since there's no known platform that jeopardizes remittance to sellers based on buyers' acknowledgment, your point about this is then invalid I guess?",2019-01-31 13:38:01,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/alb4uk/wow_i_am_impressed_by_the_efficiency_not_lazada/

Can you check if a non-registered parcel has been delivered without asking the buyer? You can't right? Neither can Lazada. If we can, we don't have to pay Singpost more for registered mail. 

Lazada is using the auto update to help sellers complete their transactions and get their payments in case buyers are too lazy to update the statuses. 

Other platforms use the same approach as Lazada.

Delivery of item is part of the process before payment is released to a seller.

bilbolaggings,"Hello, grabfood rider here. I did foodpanda for a bit before switching over to grabfood. I like grabfood more because it's a lot more flexible. I can just work whenever I want and how long I want. With foodpanda you have to book shifts, and these shifts are hotly contested in high demand areas, so you'll have to camp at midnight or pray someone let's go of a shift. 

Also grabfood's app has much better UI than foodpanda. Foodpanda's app is just really leceh. You have to deal with the dispatchers who are from Malaysia or India and a lot of them are hopelessly incompetent. 

I'd just go for grabfood if I were you. I never tried deliveroo so can't comment on that. They all pay quite closely though, I don't think there's one that earns you a lot more money than the other

Edit: Also grabfood lets you cash out your earnings whenever you want as long as it's at least $50. With foodpanda you have to wait for your pay to come in about once every 2 weeks. Sometimes your pay doesn't come in and you have to create a ticket to deal with foodpanda hq. A big waste of time tbh.

sneakpeek_bot,"> # Shared-kitchen operator asks competition watchdog to help 'level the playing field'

> SINGAPORE - A shared-kitchen operator has appealed to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) to ""help level the playing field"" after being shut out by a second food delivery operator just weeks after starting business.

> Smart City Kitchens' general manager Warren Tseng said at a press conference on Wednesday (July 17) that Deliveroo and GrabFood - which it estimates to represent about 60 per cent of the online food delivery market here - have refused to list restaurants operating out of its Tampines kitchen on their platform.

> The 13,000 sq ft facility opened last month and houses 30 individual kitchens that are rented out to food and beverage operators for delivery operations.

> Smart City Kitchens, which touts itself as the first operator here that is not affiliated with a delivery service, offers advisory and facility services, but restaurants must find their own platforms for sale and delivery.

> The CCCS said in response to queries that it is ""looking into the matter"", but is unable to provide further details at this stage.

> Some eateries operating out of Smart City Kitchens told The Straits Times last week that food delivery giant Deliveroo had refused to list them on its platform, putting a dent in their expansion plans.

> The reason they were given was that Deliveroo had decided not to work with Smart City Kitchens.

> GrabFood has since followed suit, they said on Wednesday.

> In addition to providing delivery services for restaurant partners, Deliveroo operates three shared kitchens of its own. GrabFood said earlier this year that it planned to venture into the space as well.

> Related Story Eateries using shared kitchen say Deliveroo not listing them on platform

> Foodpanda, which has two shared kitchens in Singapore where its couriers deliver from a variety of brands, has continued to partner with those operating out of Smart City Kitchens.

> Grab said in response to queries that it is ""finding the most efficient way to adopt the cloud kitchen concept onto our platform, whether with partners or on our own"".

> ""We have spoken to merchants who have reached out to us and have explained that we are unable to serve them at present. However, we will explore other ways to support them on our platform in future,"" a spokesman said.

> Deliveroo said last week that it is ""evaluating what is in the best interests of our restaurant partners and customers"".

> Mr Tseng said the moves by Deliveroo and GrabFood ""go against the spirit of fair play and healthy competition"".

> ""This has severely affected at least seven tenants who had already started operations, and is deeply concerning to over 20 others who are due to commence operations over the coming weeks,"" he said.

> Smart City Kitchens, which is affiliated with former Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick, is going ahead with plans to open three more kitchens in Singapore by year end and to expand across South-east Asia, said Mr Tseng.

> He added that there are no ongoing discussions with either Deliveroo or Grab, and that the firm is exploring working with smaller players.

> Associate Professor Lawrence Loh of the NUS Business School said food delivery services have the prerogative to choose their suppliers.

> ""If the major food delivery services are ignoring the shared kitchens, other market takers will spring up to fill the gap,"" he said.

> But Dr Seshan Ramaswami, associate professor of marketing education at Singapore Management University, said Deliveroo and GrabFood's actions may be anti-competitive.

> ""If there are legitimate reasons, such as price negotiations falling through... then of course a delivery company can refuse to do business with a provider.""

> ""If it is done just to keep a competitor out, the action might well find some response from the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore,"" he said.

source : I delivered pizza using a bicycle

If you can don't use bicycle deliver cause it's super tiring and you usually have to travel 1-2km with a heavy box weighing you down. And don't forget about upslope and barriers which just a pain tbh. But if u have escooter should be piece of cake ah. back then I deliver using bicycle after seven orders I started regretting hahahaha. 

Have talked to friends who worked with deliveroo and foodpanda seems like they almost similar system such as ranking or tiers. If I'm not wrong you'll start with a certain rank and it will increase after you done a certain amount of deliveries. then the higher ur rank the higher your pay ah also higher rank have first priority to book slots to work. Deliveroo you will select the location and time but I don't know about foodpanda or grab food if you location is fixed but the selling point of deliver boy is that you have flexible hours which is convineint for students 

pay wise basic ah the more you send the more you get sometimes peak hour amount you get per delivery can double

that's all I can think off now ah if anything I add later

DO NOT EVER order from FoodPanda. They have the WORST customer service of all the delivery options here. I've gotten 2 wrong orders from them so far, and both times they refuse to give a refund, let alone give any sort of compensation. Once I ordered dimsum at 10.50pm. Order did not come after an hour. I had to hop onto their live chat and only then did they tell me that the stall had closed before preparing my order. They said they will refund me for that, but until now have not gotten my money back. I've filed a dispute with my CC company against them. FoodPanda is the longest standing delivery service but also the most unprofessional and the most scummy.

Deliveroo is the best. Stall fucked up your order? Just report the issue in the app, and Deliveroo will either give you account credit or a refund on the items that the stall prepared wrongly. No questions asked.

UberEats comes close to Deliveroo although they take slightly longer and the riders are not as professional. On the upside, they have no minimum order and offer slightly more food options, at least in my area.

mchlyxhn,"Looks like everyone else’s deliveries were really uneventful, so I guess mine would be able to provide some comic relief.

I ordered Pastamania really late one night, and the poor delivery man looked for my address for probably 10-20 minutes before he gave up and called me to clarify, which confused the shit out of me because *whaddya mean the unit doesn’t exist? I’m sitting in the living room right now watching the door!* We kept going back and forth, furthering confusing the shit out of each other, before I finally gave up and told him to just meet me at the void deck.

After I hung up, I checked which address I entered, and it turns out, I accidentally mixed the floor number of my old address with the unit number of my new address! Lucky for me, my old place was just adjacent to my new place, so I quickly went down to get my food, and was standing in the middle of the lift lobby when the deliveryman came down. His voice was literally shaking when he asked me if I came from upstairs, and (since I didn’t want to embarrass myself) I nonchalantly said yes. I still remember the look of shock and confusion on his face when he gave me my food and walked back to his bike; I pretended to wait for the lift until he drove off, then sheepishly walked back to my new home.",2017-10-27 00:38:01,6,,,/r/singapore/comments/78tzzx/your_most_memorable_food_delivery_stories/

I thought you were somebody else"" eh u order food who else would be coming..?

- reached customer house. Customer purposely did not open the door. How did I know? A not-so-discreet ""shhh come oredy"" coming from the other side lor. Then open door and can tell me I late some more. If u want the free pizza voucher just say la we will give one, no need until liddat leh.

Please don't be that guy who wastes our time coz you never prepare the money earlier. We will do the counting for you, and usually already standby the exact change back at the store, since we know if u giving exact amount,$50 note etc (written on your order). Our hot bag on the motorcycle below got other people food to be delivered leh.

Some of us just take it in, while some of us might give you an expired voucher. Make ur life harder coz you need to call up the store, replacement ,receipt number etc.

Few hours later I pluck up my courage and texted her, ""Hey you're pretty cute blah blah"" she responded and we begin texting. I agreed to fetch her from an MRT station that very evening.

But the one aspect of FoodPanda I think Deliveroo can learn from, is to only charge the difference in the minimum order rather than a flat $4. E.g. if my dinner order is $1 short of the minimum order, then just charge me $1 rather than the flat $4.

Varantain,"Time for a Foodpanda rant:

Foodpanda has promotions from time to time, but their savings are capped at between $6 to $9, so people have to split their orders if they're ordering more than $30 worth of food.

Well, their system marked my second order as a duplicate and completely disappeared from my order history, but payment went through as I paid with Apple Pay.

Funny thing is that Foodpanda didn't communicate this at all, and the only way I found out was because I didn't receive an email for my second order (remember, though, that payment had already been taken), and couldn't find it in my order history.

They're too cheap to have phone support in Singapore, so the only way to communicate with them is through their live chat system. Some things about their live chat system:

1. push notifications don't work;

2. their agents take a while to reply, and seem to think it's fine to leave the chat after a couple of minutes of no response; and

3. their chats automatically disappear, with no way to access history if your app is closed long enough.

The only way I could get my issue resolved to its conclusion was to open my app from time to time, and keep checking for their agent's reply (hoping that they didn't think it was acceptable to leave the conversation before me). That wasn't fun, and made getting my second order either processed or refunded a serious pain.

They also made no effort at service recovery — I wasn't given anything even when I asked ""if there was anything they could do about all the inconvenience I faced"".

**tl;dr** Foodpanda's fine when it works, but isn't worth the time if one gets into trouble with their crappy app.",2018-08-06 23:18:35,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/94newv/how_is_your_experience_with_food_delivery_services/

The only major problem I faced was late deliveries. But sometimes I don't wanna blame them thanks to the unpredictable weather. It can be sunny and hot af when the order is sent, after 10 minutes the whole sky can just darken. 

Occasionally I get wrong orders, especially from Pastamania. They gave me Turkey Bacon Cheesy Crumble instead of Turkey Bacon Aglio.

erisestarrs,"I live in a spot in Hougang that's kinda near to Kovan, Serangoon and Sengkang so I'm quite well-covered by all the food delivery services. I also often order during the weekends so I have lots of experience haha.

I've used Deliveroo the most and I'm generally satisfied with their service. The food usually arrives with 30-45 mins and the one time that it was 30 mins late, they gave me a $5 voucher after I used the live chat to enquire about the delay. They also have quite a few promotions here and there which are good. The only bad thing about Deliveroo is the minimum order and how they charge a flat $4 if you don't meet it, rather than the difference between your order and the minimum order (which is what Foodpanda does).

I used Foodpanda a few times and except for the first 1-2 times I ordered, every order has been late, usually because they don't have riders so the order gets ""stuck"" (for like half an hour) until I contact the live chat. And even then, no offers of recompense... Between the minimum order ($15) and poor service, I've stopped using Foodpanda.

I've used Honestbee food delivery twice and it's been good so far - delivery is on time though perhaps their selection could be expanded. There's also no minimum order so it's my go-to option for dinner now (Deliveroo's $18 minimum order for dinner is just too much for one person).

Just tried UberEats for dinner and so far so good. It's good that there's no minimum order but they tend to have surge pricing during peak hours so it might not be such a good option.",2017-09-18 19:03:53,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/70occt/what_has_your_experience_been_with_food_delivery/

If you're referring to Deliveroo charging higher than buying from the restaurant itself, then it's not particular to Deliveroo since all the services charge the same price.

I've only recently realised that UberEats and Honestbee don't have minimum orders so I've only just started using them. But I'll still be ordering from Deliveroo because they have some ""exclusive"" partner eateries like Sushi Tei and Collins' Grille and Bento, which I like, and I haven't faced issues with my deliveries. Moving forward, I'll probably order from UberEats or Honestbee for dinner more often though, since there's no minimum order.",2017-09-18 19:28:57,1,,,/r/singapore/comments/70occt/what_has_your_experience_been_with_food_delivery/
dreadiplomat110,"Are you drawing a distinction between what you term the 'new economy' and what others call the 'gig economy'?


Gig economy would entail people utilising spare resources that they own (time, vehicles, machinery, real estate etc.) to provide services for others. When they first sprung up years ago, they were thought to be basically side hussles that could be a good source of supplementary income. The whole notion was that you could be your own boss in the gig economy. What has developed in the intervening years is that startups have identified potential gaps in the service industry and filled them using software and contract labour.


In a way, by labeling the workers as contractors, these startups can reduce their hiring costs (since healthcare and severance packages are not offered) whilst remaining able to tap into a huge workforce whenever the need arises. As long as the software for matching consumer and product remains functional, these startups are able to entrench themselves in an increasingly unassailable position as the faciliator or middleman of the transaction. To the start ups, workers are indistinguishable from one another and as such easily dispensible. From this perspective, most workers in the gig economy are unlikely to be better off than traditional full-time workers.


Of course, there are people who have a keen sense of intuition that have become successful using platforms like carousell, but these are a tiny minority.",2018-05-20 22:51:50,26,,,/r/singapore/comments/8ks6ak/people_working_in_the_new_economy_has_it_actually/

nvbtable,"Ah okay...

These jobs all have a similar profile: limited skill/experience requirement and time based earnings.

Over the time these jobs should set the bottom end wage levels. Given that gig economy participants are able to reliably earn >$3k/m, this should have positive impact across low end wages especially with immigration policy being tightened since the 11 elections.

I would ignore claims these jobs reliably pay >$5k/m as that seems more like marketing and if true will be competed down by an influx of new participants attracted by those wages.",2018-05-21 09:12:35,3,,,/r/singapore/comments/8ks6ak/people_working_in_the_new_economy_has_it_actually/
zoinks10,"Yeah, I agree with you. Based on conversations with a range of Uber drivers it seems it's perfectly possible to make the larger numbers, you just need to be out on the roads for a long time, probably for multiple shifts per day that coincide with when people are going to and from work.

If you try and do it as a ""hobby"" job where you go out when it suits you (e.g. drop the kids off at school/husband off at work and then drive during the middle of the day) you probably won't break even on it. 

I doubt the top end numbers will drop down - there will always be a group of people willing to get out there and work the longer hours. In most jobs the ones willing to put in the extra effort will take the rewards, and the gig economy definitely favours them over their lazier peers.",2018-05-21 10:35:07,5,,,/r/singapore/comments/8ks6ak/people_working_in_the_new_economy_has_it_actually/
