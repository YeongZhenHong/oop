"Is foodpanda's template reply employing some sort of psychological trick that potentially turn one's anger into confusion / amusement in an effort to make u go eerrrrrrr and stop pursuing the matter?

Throw in a random ""DID YOU KNOW??"" for extra potency so the angry customer maybe will go ""really mehhhhh??"" then become distracted, hit up Google for some fact checking instead of complaining further. 

Before the person knows it, it's already 2am and they are on the weird part of YouTube learning about toenails art.

"I once ordered from deliveroo but forgot to enter the unit number (there's no specific field for unit number, you have to enter it into special instructions), so the driver just marked it as delivered and threw away the food when he couldn't find the unit...

Luckily they refunded us, but man, what a waste of food",69,2020-11-30,16:26:59
"Top 10 reasons why Grab is awful. 

They burned through so much cash in the early days giving away vouchers and getting the drivers to jump ship. Now not sustainable have to resort to stuff liddat.

"My experience agrees.

Deliveroo reply fast and refund immediately; grab forever is still pending investigation.

"I have to say, all three have sucked at various points in time. 

Deliveroo has, more than once, not delivered orders because they could not find riders. They just kept changing the estimated arrival time until we cancelled (I’m talking teatime stuff for office ordered at 2pm that hasn’t arrived after 4pm and they still have no rider).

Foodpanda makes it insanely difficult to find the help chat, and then they go in these logical loops and keep doing stupid shit. Shit so stupid i was convinced the guy on the other side was a bot. And every time we disconnected because my screen locked while waiting for a reply, I got a new dumbass and had to repeat myself over and over. I usually only get a refund after I’ve wasted more than an hour. (Eg Foodpanda placed an order at a restaurant that was closed and replaced by a totally different restaurant, this was discovered by my rider who went to pick up the order and realised there was no such shop, and the customer service guy assured me my order would be delivered, called the rider and told him to go back, and called the ex employee of the restaurant and told him to prepare the order. When the rider called me back again I had to repeat my story. Took nearly 2 hours on the phone to get my $30 back). But they are often cheaper than grab.

Grab was only good because they had vouchers that drove down the cost of delivery. Once the vouchers are gone probably won’t use it except for self pickup.",9,2020-11-30,19:52:28
"McD should just use taller cups for the hot drinks and not fill them up to the brim. Some Indian Muslim stalls tie teh tarik in a takeaway plastic bag and pack it together with an empty cup.

Speaking from experience, I sometimes just hang it over my bike handle for short distances for the best results. LOL. Because no matter how well I fasten it inside the bag, there's bound to be spillage just because I went over a hump or got accidentally knocked about. 

same for some restaurants selling soup.",10,2020-11-30,16:58:06
"I've always preferred Deliveroo. They reply very quickly on the help chat, which I love. They're more intuitive.

As for Foodpanda, when I worked in the CBD, my colleagues and I tried them 3 times. First time: delivery was late by over 2 hours and got the order partially wrong. Second time: we ordered at 10am and they delivered at 1pm, again getting the order partially wrong. Third time was the same. We then abandoned them completely.

Grab is bleh but good example of market penetration pricing strategy.",4,2020-12-01,02:11:50

"I had a good experience with Grab though. On 9 September midnight, I ordered Grab Premium. The app showed that the fare was $30. When I had arrived at home, my card was billed $40.

"Agreed man. Grab support totally sucks. Today I had an order which supposed to deliver to my house but then the delivery address was some other random address. I called grab support and they said they cannot refund the order or at least restore the promo code I used. They will only be able to refund if their so called technical side is able to confirm there was a GPS glitch or something.

They told the rider to dispose of the food. Free meal for him I guess.",1,2020-12-01,10:46:08
Grabs pretty useless when it comes to support. Ordered some curry dish and only the rice/meat arrived. They ended up siding with the restaurant and gave me a one dollar voucher on a 25 dollar order. Stopped using them ever since,1,2020-12-01,18:08:05
"I have an unpleasant experience with Grabfood before but I felt that we were partly at fault so I did not pursue any further. But posting here because I'm curious to know if anyone has any 2 cents on whether Grab should be refunding us in our case.
Basically I helped my aunt order food via her Grab app for about 3 pax so it is a considerable amount of food. Address input was not fully complete (no unit number) and because my aunt is new to this whole food ordering thing she did not monitor her phone at all after we placed the order. Delivery man called twice, she did not hear her phone to pick it up. Around 10min passed before we realised and by then the whole transaction had been cancelled from Grab's end and there was no way we could call the delivery man back. Food did not arrive at all and Grab refused to give us refund. Thoughts? Should they have done so out of goodwill? Afterall we made payment for food that we did not receive at all. But on the other hand it is because we did not provide the full address.",1,2020-12-01,19:19:39

"I once spent 2 hours on the chats with 3 separate customer service officers from food panda. Why? Because they had offered a promo for a restaurant which had closed. The rider called to tell me. I told Foodpanda. They called the rider and the ex employee of the restaurant and insisted that my order would be delivered. I nearly hit the roof. 

Ya, it was a lot of time wasted of like $30. But after a while the money is not the point. Not being cheated is the point.",16,2020-11-30,19:44:46

App set delivery to location A (approx 1km away) but comments input delivery to location B (approx 10km away) for a fare of $5. And I'm riding a bicycle, no way was I gonna cycle 10km.

Don't think mine was a glitch but a mistake on the customer's end. Called Grab support and they told me to deliver to location A even when I knew the customer (which I had also contacted to confirm delivery location) was at location B. I went through the standard motion, wait 5-10 min and disposed of the food.

Another Grab support staff did call me when I was already at location A and said the customer called and asked if I could return the food back to the restaurant while Grab re-assigns the delivery to a motorcyclist. 

Funny how they didn't try to resolve that when I was still at the restaurant and on the line with Grab support. They didn't want to compensate me for making another trip back so yea I rejected it.

&#x200B;

Oh yea, customer was lucky it was a cash delivery order. So he didn't lose any $ or had to clawback anything from Grab. I was the sucker who had to waste over 15min on the line waiting and getting instructions and seeking clawback from Grab, which they did.",1,2020-12-01,12:30:58

"Just a theory, might be because your subscription signals a 'loyalty' to the app. You are likely already using it enough or have opted to pay, and therefore it takes less effort / costs less to keep you on. On the other hand, people not subscribed are not as loyal, and thus they throw more discounts to try to get them using the app to build up loyalty...

"Going to have to check if they increase the prices for pickup (pro vs non-pro users.) 

I mainly use pandapro for the additional 5% pickup discount. Pickup at certain stalls is much cheaper than ordering at the stall itself and you can beat the queue.

"Imagine you're Grab. FoodPanda and Deliveroo has been around for years but now you want a slice of the food delivery pie. 

So you do what you did with private hire services back when Uber was around. You cut crazy ass deals to the public in order to gain market share. Remember it began with an $8 a month subscription plan (30 deliveries, free $5 & $10 voucher and no minimum order!).

I've worked as a delivery rider before so I can tell you we can about $6 - $8 per drop (this can go even higher in certain places in town). 

And so imagine if you ordered a $10 meal. 30% goes to Grab for its fees - that's $3. But on top of that, Grab has to pay $6 - $8 to the rider who delivered your food to you. Now that's negative $3 - $5. Add in the support staff, the data scientists that are responsible for the algorithms and other staff at Grab's HQ, you can imagine that subscription plan is really not a sustainable one.

It was never meant to be around forever. It's only goal was to gain market share and monopolise the food delivery market in terms of both customers and riders (so many people have gone over from Panda/Kangaroo).

And the COVID-19 crisis was just a catalyst. Higher demand and people willing to pay extra fees. 

No, I do not work for Grab and i'm not some Grab-fanatic. 

In fact, while as a food delivery rider in the past (for Panda) i benefitted from the price wars, I thought it was really stupid delivering $6.50 foods when I was getting $8 for it.

"This view is rather entitled. Food delivery is not a necessity (save for exceptions - those physically or otherwise impaired). Grab/deliveroo are private enterprises, not a charity. Just because you may have used their services before doesn't mean they owe you anything.

"Contrary to popular belief, this is a money losing business and the increase in customers isn't necessarily translating into profits. The Wall Street Journal had an article about it: [America Is Stuck at Home, but Food-Delivery Companies Still Struggle to Profit ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-is-stuck-at-home-but-food-delivery-companies-still-struggle-to-profit-11589374801).

> Sales for Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash Inc. and Postmates Inc. are growing, according to the companies and credit-card data.

> But increased costs to fund promotions and safety equipment on one hand, and pressure to reduce commissions for strapped restaurants on the other, have created an even worse financial proposition for food-delivery companies.

It's likely the situation is similar in Singapore.",6,2020-05-17,15:07:04
"Unpopular opinion - I think what they are doing is necessary.

The simple reality is that for all their size, none of them are profitable because their costs scale in line with the number of customers they service. This isn’t like Google or telcos where their costs are fixed in nature (ie: server / infrastructure costs), and marginal cost of serving each additional user is close to zero. 

With food delivery companies, they have no such benefit. Each additional order means they need to assign an extra rider to bring that food to your doorstep (and pay that rider), so there is really no economies of scale to be had here. 

As such, the irony here is that more people ordering food online actually means bigger losses for these companies. And the only way to stem these losses is to charge higher prices. They can’t take a higher cut from the restaurants than they already are, so that leaves the consumer in the form of higher fees and / or minimum orders. 

Under normal circumstances, competition is likely stiff enough, and the orders so few that the food delivery companies won’t dare to do such a thing. Right now, there are probably enough people using their services that these companies are comfortable raising prices. Yes, some might get turned off by this (but who are you going to switch to really), but there would still be enough customers left who are willing to pay their higher asking prices. 

That’s just my take at least. They are firing their worst customers, defined as those who are not earning them any money. And I don’t blame them. I believe that one side-effect of this pandemic is the acceleration of existing trends, and given the current lack of profitability of these food delivery companies, it felt inevitable really.",28,2020-05-17,12:01:05
"Tbh I don't blame businesses for exploiting this opportunity to pump up their profits. They need to continue operations and in the end the employees benefit too.

BUT I freaking hate it when they pretend to be all warm and cuddly as if they are doing all the good in the world. Example is Grab coming up with that social media post about how they are helping everyone else and barely have profits.

But they could have handled it better, especially during a pandemic. Imagine the free marketing they can get if they didn't capitalise on this shituation. People will love them even more lol
 
Their main business, the grab car grab share that wing, can't earn them money because of this virus. Of course they have to balance it out by making grab food more profitable.

As a rider, I definitely want the companies to pay more - who doesn't lol. And given the increased risks of such a job right now, it would be nice if they did.

But at the same time, when I look at how much they're paying us sometimes after incentives and all, I also scratch my head wondering how the hell they make money. The money has to come from somewhere what - if not the rider then obv the customer.

At the very least Roo is a little more ethical than Grab with regard to changes in their subscriptions - they do email you to tell you stuff is changing.",4,2020-05-17,14:31:30
"they are not charity and they, like all businesses, have to manage their cashflow and income statement properly. There is no obligation for companies to assist the situation with no benefits and incurring even more expenses. It's just a moral expectation from the public. Besides, they have been burning cash from the start with promotions, discounts etc which likely alot of people have benefited from, even before this covid-19 situation started.

Don't give them business? Then they have to let go your very own singaporean employees...that is if you are ok with that. Running a business and being a salaried person are vastly different.",7,2020-05-17,12:10:13

"Think about it this way, the general customer base been benefiting from their services prior to this. Prior to CB, cheaper delivery + greater convenience(vs what the market provided) was gained from using their service, which came at the cost of Grab's equity. Someone was paying for the benefit customers accrued.

So right now they are trying to head at least towards the direction of breaking even by raising prices. On top of that, the companies have loss a lot of goodwill(hard to quantify but valuable) with their customers. I believe the market will vote with their wallets on this.

Maybe this can even settle this experiment that transport/delivery prices have found its equilibrium. Maybe all along, there is always going to be that large gap in, prices people are willing to provide delivery/transport, vs prices people are willing to pay for that service.",2,2020-05-17,19:58:40

Anyone with any common sense on how businesses profit would understand that giving 50 free deliveries each month to a customer would result in 150 bucks spent/ loss to the firm. They in turn might pass this cost  on to the food vendors or the delivery riders (in the form of lower incentives for example).

"$14.50 service fee is ridiculous, but who am I to criticise the consumer if they are willing to pay that much? Though the last few times I checked the grab app, their delivery fee has largely remained constant at $3 to $3.50, so this higher pricing might be confined to certain areas with higher volume of orders. 

So yay for living in a more ulu portion of Bukit Panjang? 😛 

I am currently on a Foodpanda monthly plan, where I pay $8 a month for 15 free deliveries (and I used all 15 last billing cycle, for a savings of $37). My mom and I don’t cook, so on other occasions, we either get food from the coffee shop downstairs (and supplement with canned food), or eat bread / instant noodles. 

I am going to assume that Foodpanda absorbs the cost of this promotion. My orders range from $18 (Wok hey) to $30 (Flaming Don) for two people, so I estimate that Foodpanda is not really earning all that much from me. 

The article you linked to also has some inconsistencies. Since Grab is the company handling the payment processing, they will likely be the ones to absorb the credit card fees as well (and I suspect their use of paylater is a bid to cut down on processing fees by consolidating all the receipts into one lump sum). 

But yeah, I did switch from Grabfood back to Foodpanda early this year when Grab significantly cut back on their promotions, and their use of paylater meant I am not able to benefit from my credit card rewards the same way I do with Foodpanda.

"Hmm extremely good points. My thinking was along the line of, if they provide the subscription previously when deliveries weren’t as high a demand, why would they remove it when demand is up and they’re presumably earning more? Unless I’m retarded and they’re actually making a loss from the increased demand in deliveries. I mean it’s nice for companies to have a little empathy for the small group of people but that’s in an idealistic world which we’re clearly not in. Definitely don’t have the intention to bring down the business. 

I admit, i might be taking it a little personally. I have always been a huge fan of grab and have been supporting them since the start, loyal to 3 subscriptions, 1 being the free delivery even when I didn’t need to deliver as much before the CB. However it’s kind of frustrating for right now as I have to serve SHN, thanks ns! So when I actually had more use for the coupons, they came and remove it. Adding salt onto wound, delivery fees has steeply been increased. What was $4 before CB is now suddenly at $8. I wouldn’t be this frustrated if I had the choice to opt for pick up.

For both Grab and Deliveroo, there are clear clauses reserving the right to change the benefits under the subscription plans subject to notice being given by email or in-app prior to implementation (for Deliveroo) and notices given via email it in-app two billing cycles beforehand (for Grab). 

Both services also clearly reserve the right of termination at their discretion, and you are also not charged if the subscription is cancelled. You also have an ongoing month by month subscription and as consumer you are also entitled to cancel at any time (within a billing cycle). Not unreasonable right?

These clauses are pretty prominently displayed in the short summarised version of Grab's T&C, and is the third and forth bullet point under the first clause you see for Deliveroo Plus. They gave you prior notice, how is it bad faith? 

If you never read the T&Cs because you blindly click that you did and subscribe, **that's on you**. If you never check your email and missed the notice or dismissed the in-app notification, that's also on you. Deliveroo's terms entitle you to cancel with immediate effect after you receive a notice of change, and you get a refund of what you paid for that month. It's a fair exchange between willing buyer, willing seller.

I keep seeing you reply to comments saying they’re off-topic, when they’re addressing something else you said. You can’t facilitate a meaningful discussion if everything needs to somehow tunnel-vision to your main point.

That aside, let me address your main point. I assume you know about supply and demand. Since the demand is spiking, if they kept everything at the status quo, it wouldn’t make sense to their shareholders, the people who invest money in the company. Given that Grab isn’t a running a charity, and is profit-oriented, why wouldn’t they increase delivery fees to make more money? You can feel free to boycott them, but they’re not doing anything wrong.

Addressing your ‘extended logic’, it isn’t very logical. Grab isn’t monopolising life-saving insulin, or something you cannot live without. If restaurants increase prices to a point where you can’t afford it, feel free to cook at home. They have access to cooking utensils and ingredients, and so do you. They have heat with which to cook, and arms with which to use, and so do you. This is wholly different from growing your own veggies. You can reasonably be expected to cook your own food, but no one is expecting you to grow vegetables at a sufficient rate, nor do you have the land available to do so.

There's 8000 cases out of 6million population, very conservative estimate 1 infected out of 750. This doesn't even count the asymptomatic people who might outnumber that 8000 by 2-3 times. 

He's very likely to have visited a family with symptomatic person by the end of the month once. virus hops on him, he's asymptomatic, but shares it with the rest of the 1000 families he meets.

>So he, and by extension of your reasoning, all delivery men should not be out delivering food? And food parcels, and groceries etc?

He shouldn't be doing the numbers he's doing.

Many of us aren't meeting friends anymore, its to cut down on the number of people that could possibly be infected. Don't do what's unnecessary.

Delivering food is necessary, but exploiting the high period to make a buck is wholly irresponsible.

>He’s doing his job to help us get food, you don’t think he deserves the money?

>Are you jelly about the money he earns?

Deserves? Sure he does. For the labour he's putting in, of course he deserves to be properly compensated. He has to be working 70-80 hour weeks to get there.

Jelly? perhaps. But not for the money, but the lack of responsibility he has shown. He can earn all he wants with little care, he risks himself and his customers, but since government is paying for his medical bills if he does get infected, why would he stop the cashflow?

There are certainly other ways of making extra cash a month that doesnt endanger the lives of others.

>If x number if people visits your house to provide food, What difference does it make if x is by the same person?

>If y number of customers dial for food, what is the difference if 100% of y deliveries were made by the same version vs made by z number of people?

Best case scenario, little clustering occurs. Viral cases are restricted to linked families. This occurs when delivery orders to persistent families are equally spread amongst all deliveryman to reduce house-to-house contamination.

Realistic scenario, small clustering occurs tied to 1 deliveryman visiting affected family then moving on. This occurs when uneven distribution of orders, that 1 guy gets more orders than others -> visit more families -> more chances of visiting someone infected -> more families visit and infect by virtue of having more orders. Of course this is a portion luck as well, as the casual deliveryman with less orders may be the one who has to visit the infected family, and cluster is small, but probability again is smaller than above.

Worst case scenario. 1 big cluster. Absolute inequality, if 1 person does all deliveries, Just 1 family is infected and he risks all of them.

So yes there is a difference, this guy is unfortunately closer to the bad end of case scenario continuum, considering he's at the end of the bell curve, ie probably has most orders?",-72,2020-04-20,16:12:10

The tricky part about bell curve grading is that in order to get to the 99th percentile, you'll have to climb over a significant number of people. Being above-average isn't gonna do you much good since you'd still be stuck near the crest; you've gotta be god-like.

"When I first started, Grabfood hasn’t launched yet, it was still Ubereats. I chose Panda simply because in my residential area, it was obvious panda was the dominant player at the time (there were much more panda riders compared to others). Normally riders would work in the neighbourhood where they live due to the familiarity. 

I think one major point most non-riders are not aware of is the flexibility of work. For roo and grab, they can simply turn on their app and their status will be online and they can start working for however long they want until they decide to log out and be offline. As for panda, you have to book shifts one week in advance and there are limited slots for different times throughout the day. You can’t just simply log in and be online to start work, and those shifts vary in duration. 

My observation during Circuit breaker, there was one weekend where there were many Grab riders with no orders because a whole bunch of them went online but there was not a proportionate demand for orders. For panda I feel that by having shifts it makes sure at each time of the day there is a certain number of riders to proportionately meet demand so it ensures when we work there are orders. But in terms of other normal days, if I can’t book shift, I lose out and can’t work whereas Grab and Roo riders have the most flexibility in this. 

In terms of earnings, it’s hard for me to say which platform you can earn more because I haven’t tried all of them. I can only say, I’ve been in the game long enough to experience 3 different types of services fee structures from foodpanda, namely: hourly + order, distance + order, and order based only. The latter is the current one and I feel it is the one which I have been earning the most.

Boycott Grab!,-6,2020-05-09,05:15:51
"Percentage based commission doesn’t make sense for the merchants. E.g let’s assume a 30% commission on a $10 order = $3 for Grab. But if the order is $100 then 25% commission = $25. Grab’s cost doesn’t change at all whether the order is $10 or $100 because it’s still one single rider doing the delivery, so what Grab is doing is losing money on the smaller orders in the hopes that they will have enough big orders to cover their losses. 

One solution is to move away from percentage based to a rate structure such as:
-	$X for orders $10 or below
-	$X*1.3 for orders between $10-$19.99
-	$X*1.6 for orders between $20-$29.99
and so on...

The main problem with delivery is that it’s always a value-losing proposition with small orders because of the disproportionately high percentage of cost to order value. At the same time, the majority of orders are small orders. This is not a problem that can be easily solved.",-1,2020-05-09,10:08:55
"A GrabFood cyclist gets about $5/delivery. So if your delivery fee is $3-4, GrabFood tops up $2-1 of the XX% to the cyclist. So it makes perfect sense they introduced the minimum order value otherwise they would be bleeding for a $5 food order delivery.

They’ve also been adding more “along the way” jobs to delivery so the overall topup gets even lower. 2x typical $5/jobs suddenly becomes 1x $9/2jobs.

A cyclist needs to travel to restaurant A, wait and collect, then restaurant B, wait and collect before delivering to customer A and then customer B or the other way round.",15,2020-05-09,00:20:29

"Your solution doesn’t seem that much different from a percentage-based commission structure. The cut is still based on the order amount. 

I agree with your analysis that smaller deliveries are not worth it, but look at it this way. Your delivery crew still have to be paid regardless of whether they are working or not. If you set the minimum order limit too high and too few people order, this means your manpower is seriously going under-utilised. 

One solution I can think of is if you can get customers to place their order way in advance, which may then give the company time to consolidate the orders and see how best to deploy their manpower. For example, perhaps the software could identify that 4 of the orders from say, Streats at BPP are going to families living in the same block. One driver could then be instructed to collect them all and deliver them all at one shot, rather than having 4 different people make 4 separate trips. 

This would mean that the company doesn’t need to hire as many delivery people, which may cut down on their costs.",-1,2020-05-09,10:58:10

"Just remember to use your resto's own website to order when possible. I'd ordered a pizza or two a month through (the red one) before reading about the cut they and their competitors take on every order. I doubt that the pizza place would pay their own delivery riders _less_ than the bigs.

OTOH, the actual value that GF/FP/Doo bring to the client resto *and* the paying customer is *discovery*, for which I can see paying the current markups — *once.* It would be interesting if one of the bigs were to rebrand themselves as a ""local restaurant discovery service"", admit up front that they take (the current cut) *for the first order*, with 1/3 to 1/2 the cut for subsequent orders from the same customer to the same client. I bet they'd do better than people seem to think. Would it be *enough* better to turn a sustainable profit? Probably not, but I wonder how those companies are less profitable here than in other countries (where labour costs are generally higher to boot)?",3,2020-05-09,03:42:00

Wondering how many hours it would take these guys to close up shop once the investor-cash free flow dried up.

"They don't care, the delivery riders are all considered individual contractors.  No orders to deliver means no payment to them.

"Optimal route? That is total BS.
It’s more like slotting any additional order nearby and re-sorting the sequence after.

I’ll give you an example:
collect from Dhoby Ghaut, deliver to Somerset.
Then in between, they slot in an another order: collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton..

You would have thought, hey wow, one straight line... optimal! 
BUT their sequence WILL be re-sorted to collect from Dhoby Ghaut, collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton, deliver to Somerset just because you have to collect all your orders first before you start delivering. So if you are the customer waiting at Somerset, good luck to you. And even lagi good luck to you if Orchard is a long waiting queue BBT shop and customer at Newton decides to be pesky and not include their full address or pick up the rider’s call.

PS: it is their guideline to follow the sequence because you are supposed to update the app upon every collection, delivery action. So if suddenly, your delivery is at your door even when you did not receive that auto “your food is on the way” message, it’s most likely because the rider improvised at a risk of not adhering to their guidelines.",18,2020-05-09,08:36:21

"A lot of them have websites that are seriously CMI. I tried ordering McDonald’s using their own app and the experience was frankly terrible. Food came late and there were missing orders. Never had an issue with Grab. 

We can crap on the Foodpanda / deliveroo / Grabfood companies all we want, but the key reason why we keep going back to their apps is because they are so easy to use. I open the app, select the food I want, key in my address and make payment. Foodpanda and Deliveroo even support Apple Pay, which meant that for the longest time, I didn’t even need to key in my credit card details. 

It also means that I don’t need to have half a dozen restaurant apps or websites saved on my phone as well. 

If you ask me, it feels wasteful for each restaurant to manage their own delivery crew. From an efficiency standpoint, it makes more sense for something like this to be centralised so that the company can deploy manpower to whichever restaurant needs more support at any one time, allowing each eatery to focus solely on preparing their food.

"Yeah, you're right. Web design here seems stuck in the late 1990s, particularly with regard to language support (the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/ws/languages) are probably still the gold standard here).

I also basically agree that having scores of different delivery fleets is wasteful and a business opportunity in its own right. Maybe, if the bigs don't make their payment scheme more sustainable for the restos and ethical for the customers, an association of restaurateurs could organise a cost-neutral delivery system. Order from whatever restaurant you like, either through their app or the association's, and the association's delivery drivers will get your food to your door.

Advantages over the current system:

* Delivery as a cost-neutral (commercial non-profit) service;
* Lower prices to the customer, and the ability for individual restaurants to experiment with their own promotions more than is presently done; and, not least
* Money made here stays here, and isn't spent on servicing the (all international) bigs' debt.

Doing a multilingual Web/phone app with modern tooling isn't as hard as the way most Singapore sites go about it, and so having an independent, *fully local* site/app with broad visibility and uptake would be a much-needed wake-up call to cheap-at-any-cost Singaporean businesses' Web sites. (20 years' Web development speaking here; the local Web environment is positively *enraging* to anybody who knows anything about modern standards.

Once I'm halfway to the customer's location then I will turn on the other one and accept any orders that come in. Or you could leave deliveroo always online and only accept if it is on the way (need to know your area well). Good thing about deliveroo is that you can reject orders unlimited times. Both panda and grab has penalties if you reject orders. 

However the reality is that most of the time, only grab will have consistent orders as deliveroo is quite dead in the heartlands. If you use a motorbike you might have much better success, as it is very obvious that deliveroo prioritise motorbike riders (i use bicycle).",175,2021-02-10,23:21:55

"Delivery bro, you may live close by but other families can't leave their kids alone nor bring them out. 

Hence, Grabfood😎👍",5,2020-04-10,16:35:37
"Just received an e-mail from them, looks like they moved it forward.

Here's the e-mail I got:

>**Changes to your fees** From today, you’ll begin to see a ‘minimum spend’ of $18 displayed for Plus free delivery in-app. Your subscription means that you don't pay any delivery fee, as long as the order meets the minimum spend for that restaurant - no matter how far the delivery is or how often you order.

For those that order for a family or with their partners, this isn't going to make a huge difference. Your average order for 2 people via Deliveroo is going to be $25 at the very least.

This however, does impact anyone that orders just for one like people living by themselves or with flatmates. $18 for one person for a single meal is pretty high.

This is probably a strategy to remove exactly those people from their subscription base and focus on bigger margins for themselves with less orders rather than razor thin margins (or negative) with low order values.

Overall, Plus subscribers that are single or order for one:

1. Cancel their subscription out of annoyance and order with FoodPanda or GrabFood and pay the same delivery fee. Those guys have more inventory / restaurants on their apps.
2. Those that are living with flatmates probably have one or more people subscribed, so all but one will keep their subscription and they'll end up ordering together.
3. Order lunch and dinner together. Keep dinner, heat it up later.",10,2020-05-01,19:00:15
"I see it as inevitable. Delivery costs are a fixed cost (because you pay your delivery crew), while the revenue they get from each order depends on how much the customer orders. This is probably the only way they can break even, and I am guessing that they dare to do it because grab is already implementing it, and for all we know, foodpanda may not be far behind.",18,2020-05-01,20:07:10
"Grabfood rider here. Deliveroo pays the most to its rider. Double and sometimes triple of what the other 2 companies pay.  
  
Deliveroo is popular in the central region but for the neighbourhood region, you'll be lucky to get 1 deliveroo order in 4 hours. Some riders will keep deliveroo's app on while working for the other 2 companies.  
  
It comes as no surprise that they are facing problems now. They have a very niche market because their list of merchants are mostly atas, central based and expensive. With offices closed in CBD, they probably lose the core group of their customers.",4,2020-05-02,06:49:22
Theres this guy sharing the same account between multiple units in a condo block.... loopholes man...,1,2020-05-01,23:13:59
"Easy, just don't subscribe to plus. But to be fair to them, it's still a good idea to have plus if you are ordering for you and your family since it's likely you're going to spend $18+",1,2020-05-02,03:33:11
"Hi, may I ask what are the extra special deals / discounts given to Deliveroo Plus users?",1,2020-05-19,15:11:51
Yet another reason to learn how to cook or go support your neighborhood hawker and dabao from them.,1,2020-05-01,21:08:32
"Is it unethical to make decisions that ensure the survival of your business? The economics of being an aggregator like Food Panda or Deliveroo are not great, and they lose money on their smaller orders (i.e. Fast Food orders) if they don't put a sufficient floor on basket size.  

They're struggling so much that they even had to [lay off](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/deliveroo-lays-off-25-of-singapore-staff-amid-covid-19-economic-downturn) 25% of their Singapore corporate office staff, so I we can hardly fault them for trying improve their unit economics.",-3,2020-05-01,23:12:21

"Ya just order more than keep in fridge, heat up and noms.  


Also it's just more efficient to order more and a bigger order means that your favourite restaurant can get more money to survive this period",2,2020-05-01,19:25:20
"Deliveroo has one of the lower delivery fees around though, can be as low as half of what Grab is charging during peak hours. So the value proposition of sticking with Roo is still somewhat there.",1,2020-05-01,23:27:20
"To my knowledge, FP doesn't have free delivery, subscription plans, much less unlimited free delivery. But I never ordered anything during CB, only picked up once from FP",4,2020-05-01,20:19:19
I think OP is referring to the change in minimum spend being suddenly brought forward without notice (when the email had stated it would only start in June) to be unethical...,5,2020-05-01,23:25:46
"Yeah I started to order multiple meals for like two days, saves some of the cost and effort.",1,2020-05-02,00:34:39
"Foodpanda is also trialing a subscription plan right now which I am on. I pay $8 a month for 15 free deliveries during that time. There’s three tiers, with the highest one offering up for 50 free deliveries, but I don’t need that many.",4,2020-05-01,20:23:17
"That could have still been something they had to do to ensure their business could survive during this time. It's not unethical and probably within their T&C that customers agreed with when signing up for the plan. 
They're a business and not a charity. If this change is needed effective immediately in order for them to maintain a healthy cash flow, then they should be doing that to retain their employees and business afloat",-1,2020-05-02,00:39:38
Where do you see the plans on the FP app?,1,2020-05-01,20:27:10

"Ah a beta. Yeah, makes sense they would give it to heavier users. $8 for 15 free deliveries sounds better than anything else you can get from the other 2 companies.",1,2020-05-01,21:09:59

Yes from credit/debit. Thanks for the info.,1,2020-05-01,01:58:07
For Deliveroo there's an option to tip (below your total order) before you check out for payment.,1,2020-05-01,20:23:02
