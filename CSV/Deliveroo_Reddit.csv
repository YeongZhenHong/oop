doc_naf,"I have to say, all three have sucked at various points in time. 

Deliveroo has, more than once, not delivered orders because they could not find riders. They just kept changing the estimated arrival time until we cancelled (I’m talking teatime stuff for office ordered at 2pm that hasn’t arrived after 4pm and they still have no rider).

Foodpanda makes it insanely difficult to find the help chat, and then they go in these logical loops and keep doing stupid shit. Shit so stupid i was convinced the guy on the other side was a bot. And every time we disconnected because my screen locked while waiting for a reply, I got a new dumbass and had to repeat myself over and over. I usually only get a refund after I’ve wasted more than an hour. (Eg Foodpanda placed an order at a restaurant that was closed and replaced by a totally different restaurant, this was discovered by my rider who went to pick up the order and realised there was no such shop, and the customer service guy assured me my order would be delivered, called the rider and told him to go back, and called the ex employee of the restaurant and told him to prepare the order. When the rider called me back again I had to repeat my story. Took nearly 2 hours on the phone to get my $30 back). But they are often cheaper than grab.

Grab was only good because they had vouchers that drove down the cost of delivery. Once the vouchers are gone probably won’t use it except for self pickup.",2020-11-30 19:52:28,8,,/r/singapore/comments/k3qqvp/customer_service_deliveroo_vs_foodpanda_vs_grab/

Second time: we ordered at 10am and they delivered at 1pm, again getting the order partially wrong. Third time was the same. We then abandoned them completely.

archerfrase,"I have an unpleasant experience with Grabfood before but I felt that we were partly at fault so I did not pursue any further. But posting here because I'm curious to know if anyone has any 2 cents on whether Grab should be refunding us in our case.
Basically I helped my aunt order food via her Grab app for about 3 pax so it is a considerable amount of food. Address input was not fully complete (no unit number) and because my aunt is new to this whole food ordering thing she did not monitor her phone at all after we placed the order. Delivery man called twice, she did not hear her phone to pick it up. Around 10min passed before we realised and by then the whole transaction had been cancelled from Grab's end and there was no way we could call the delivery man back. Food did not arrive at all and Grab refused to give us refund. Thoughts? Should they have done so out of goodwill? Afterall we made payment for food that we did not receive at all. But on the other hand it is because we did not provide the full address.",2020-12-01 19:19:39,1,,/r/singapore/comments/k3qqvp/customer_service_deliveroo_vs_foodpanda_vs_grab/

Don't think mine was a glitch but a mistake on the customer's end.

I went through the standard motion, wait 5-10 min and disposed of the food.

Another Grab support staff did call me when I was already at location A and said the customer called and asked if I could return the food back to the restaurant while Grab re-assigns the delivery to a motorcyclist. 

Funny how they didn't try to resolve that when I was still at the restaurant and on the line with Grab support. They didn't want to compensate me for making another trip back so yea I rejected it.

wildflowersgrow,"Imagine you're Grab. FoodPanda and Deliveroo has been around for years but now you want a slice of the food delivery pie. 

So you do what you did with private hire services back when Uber was around. You cut crazy ass deals to the public in order to gain market share. Remember it began with an $8 a month subscription plan (30 deliveries, free $5 & $10 voucher and no minimum order!).

I've worked as a delivery rider before so I can tell you we can about $6 - $8 per drop (this can go even higher in certain places in town). 

And so imagine if you ordered a $10 meal. 30% goes to Grab for its fees - that's $3. But on top of that, Grab has to pay $6 - $8 to the rider who delivered your food to you. Now that's negative $3 - $5. Add in the support staff, the data scientists that are responsible for the algorithms and other staff at Grab's HQ, you can imagine that subscription plan is really not a sustainable one.

It was never meant to be around forever. It's only goal was to gain market share and monopolise the food delivery market in terms of both customers and riders (so many people have gone over from Panda/Kangaroo).

And the COVID-19 crisis was just a catalyst. Higher demand and people willing to pay extra fees. 

No, I do not work for Grab and i'm not some Grab-fanatic. 

In fact, while as a food delivery rider in the past (for Panda) i benefitted from the price wars, I thought it was really stupid delivering $6.50 foods when I was getting $8 for it.

Just thought even as a consumer, if we aspire to be savvy, we have to look both sides of the picture, not just ours.

ngrenjie,"Unpopular opinion - I think what they are doing is necessary.

The simple reality is that for all their size, none of them are profitable because their costs scale in line with the number of customers they service. This isn’t like Google or telcos where their costs are fixed in nature (ie: server / infrastructure costs), and marginal cost of serving each additional user is close to zero. 

With food delivery companies, they have no such benefit. Each additional order means they need to assign an extra rider to bring that food to your doorstep (and pay that rider), so there is really no economies of scale to be had here. 

As such, the irony here is that more people ordering food online actually means bigger losses for these companies. And the only way to stem these losses is to charge higher prices. They can’t take a higher cut from the restaurants than they already are, so that leaves the consumer in the form of higher fees and / or minimum orders. 

Under normal circumstances, competition is likely stiff enough, and the orders so few that the food delivery companies won’t dare to do such a thing. Right now, there are probably enough people using their services that these companies are comfortable raising prices. Yes, some might get turned off by this (but who are you going to switch to really), but there would still be enough customers left who are willing to pay their higher asking prices. 

That’s just my take at least. They are firing their worst customers, defined as those who are not earning them any money. And I don’t blame them. I believe that one side-effect of this pandemic is the acceleration of existing trends, and given the current lack of profitability of these food delivery companies, it felt inevitable really.",2020-05-17 12:01:05,26,,/r/singapore/comments/gl7c7z/anyone_going_to_talk_about_money_minting_by_grab/

Prior to CB, cheaper delivery + greater convenience(vs what the market provided) was gained from using their service, which came at the cost of Grab's equity. Someone was paying for the benefit customers accrued.

So right now they are trying to head at least towards the direction of breaking even by raising prices. On top of that, the companies have loss a lot of goodwill(hard to quantify but valuable) with their customers. I believe the market will vote with their wallets on this.

Maybe this can even settle this experiment that transport/delivery prices have found its equilibrium.

ngrenjie,"$14.50 service fee is ridiculous, but who am I to criticise the consumer if they are willing to pay that much? Though the last few times I checked the grab app, their delivery fee has largely remained constant at $3 to $3.50, so this higher pricing might be confined to certain areas with higher volume of orders. 

So yay for living in a more ulu portion of Bukit Panjang? 😛 

I am currently on a Foodpanda monthly plan, where I pay $8 a month for 15 free deliveries (and I used all 15 last billing cycle, for a savings of $37). My mom and I don’t cook, so on other occasions, we either get food from the coffee shop downstairs (and supplement with canned food), or eat bread / instant noodles. 

I am going to assume that Foodpanda absorbs the cost of this promotion. My orders range from $18 (Wok hey) to $30 (Flaming Don) for two people, so I estimate that Foodpanda is not really earning all that much from me. 

The article you linked to also has some inconsistencies. Since Grab is the company handling the payment processing, they will likely be the ones to absorb the credit card fees as well (and I suspect their use of paylater is a bid to cut down on processing fees by consolidating all the receipts into one lump sum). 

But yeah, I did switch from Grabfood back to Foodpanda early this year when Grab significantly cut back on their promotions, and their use of paylater meant I am not able to benefit from my credit card rewards the same way I do with Foodpanda.

JokerMother,"Hmm extremely good points. My thinking was along the line of, if they provide the subscription previously when deliveries weren’t as high a demand, why would they remove it when demand is up and they’re presumably earning more? Unless I’m retarded and they’re actually making a loss from the increased demand in deliveries. I mean it’s nice for companies to have a little empathy for the small group of people but that’s in an idealistic world which we’re clearly not in. Definitely don’t have the intention to bring down the business. 

I admit, i might be taking it a little personally. I have always been a huge fan of grab and have been supporting them since the start, loyal to 3 subscriptions, 1 being the free delivery even when I didn’t need to deliver as much before the CB. However it’s kind of frustrating for right now as I have to serve SHN, thanks ns! So when I actually had more use for the coupons, they came and remove it. Adding salt onto wound, delivery fees has steeply been increased. What was $4 before CB is now suddenly at $8. I wouldn’t be this frustrated if I had the choice to opt for pick up. My grandmother also have been unable to leave her house and calling delivery for her was the best choice. 

I mean being in an oligopoly does have its perks even if the consumers suffer.",2020-05-17 14:51:05,-2,,/r/singapore/comments/gl7c7z/anyone_going_to_talk_about_money_minting_by_grab/

1) Restaurants are not overloaded. They have lost over 50% of business, and hence they are providing extended delivery to increase sales. Grab is charging upwards of 30% commission to restaurants , thereby leading restaurants to lower profit % to increase sales in order to pay their employees. So it is grabs profit again

2) I have spoken to few delivery guys. While the number of orders has in fact increased (they are typically doing 1.2x orders), the incremental money they are making is negligible.

thatsmyshirt,"Ehhh it's either illegal or not, not halfway. And what's your basis for alleging bad faith? They never cheat you of your money what.

For both Grab and Deliveroo, there are clear clauses reserving the right to change the benefits under the subscription plans subject to notice being given by email or in-app prior to implementation (for Deliveroo) and notices given via email it in-app two billing cycles beforehand (for Grab). 

Both services also clearly reserve the right of termination at their discretion, and you are also not charged if the subscription is cancelled. You also have an ongoing month by month subscription and as consumer you are also entitled to cancel at any time (within a billing cycle). Not unreasonable right?

These clauses are pretty prominently displayed in the short summarised version of Grab's T&C, and is the third and forth bullet point under the first clause you see for Deliveroo Plus. They gave you prior notice, how is it bad faith? 

If you never read the T&Cs because you blindly click that you did and subscribe, **that's on you**. If you never check your email and missed the notice or dismissed the in-app notification, that's also on you. Deliveroo's terms entitle you to cancel with immediate effect after you receive a notice of change, and you get a refund of what you paid for that month. It's a fair exchange between willing buyer, willing seller.

VelvetGlider,"My comment was not off-topic, because you were the one who brought up the statement that almost everyone relies on delivery. I keep seeing you reply to comments saying they’re off-topic, when they’re addressing something else you said. You can’t facilitate a meaningful discussion if everything needs to somehow tunnel-vision to your main point.

That aside, let me address your main point. I assume you know about supply and demand. Since the demand is spiking, if they kept everything at the status quo, it wouldn’t make sense to their shareholders, the people who invest money in the company. Given that Grab isn’t a running a charity, and is profit-oriented, why wouldn’t they increase delivery fees to make more money? You can feel free to boycott them, but they’re not doing anything wrong.

Addressing your ‘extended logic’, it isn’t very logical. Grab isn’t monopolising life-saving insulin, or something you cannot live without. If restaurants increase prices to a point where you can’t afford it, feel free to cook at home. They have access to cooking utensils and ingredients, and so do you.

aortm,"except he might be acting as a vector for viral spread. Above comment implied ~ 6-10$ com per delivery. assuming 1 delivery per household, he met with over 700-1000 families over this month. 

There's 8000 cases out of 6million population, very conservative estimate 1 infected out of 750. This doesn't even count the asymptomatic people who might outnumber that 8000 by 2-3 times. 

He's very likely to have visited a family with symptomatic person by the end of the month once. virus hops on him, he's asymptomatic, but shares it with the rest of the 1000 families he meets.

>So he, and by extension of your reasoning, all delivery men should not be out delivering food? And food parcels, and groceries etc?

He shouldn't be doing the numbers he's doing.

Many of us aren't meeting friends anymore, its to cut down on the number of people that could possibly be infected. Don't do what's unnecessary.

Delivering food is necessary, but exploiting the high period to make a buck is wholly irresponsible.

>He’s doing his job to help us get food, you don’t think he deserves the money?

>Are you jelly about the money he earns?

Deserves? Sure he does. For the labour he's putting in, of course he deserves to be properly compensated. He has to be working 70-80 hour weeks to get there.

Jelly? perhaps. But not for the money, but the lack of responsibility he has shown. He can earn all he wants with little care, he risks himself and his customers, but since government is paying for his medical bills if he does get infected, why would he stop the cashflow?

There are certainly other ways of making extra cash a month that doesnt endanger the lives of others.

>If x number if people visits your house to provide food, What difference does it make if x is by the same person?

>If y number of customers dial for food, what is the difference if 100% of y deliveries were made by the same version vs made by z number of people?

Best case scenario, little clustering occurs. Viral cases are restricted to linked families. This occurs when delivery orders to persistent families are equally spread amongst all deliveryman to reduce house-to-house contamination.

Realistic scenario, small clustering occurs tied to 1 deliveryman visiting affected family then moving on. This occurs when uneven distribution of orders, that 1 guy gets more orders than others -> visit more families -> more chances of visiting someone infected -> more families visit and infect by virtue of having more orders. Of course this is a portion luck as well, as the casual deliveryman with less orders may be the one who has to visit the infected family, and cluster is small, but probability again is smaller than above.

Worst case scenario. 1 big cluster. Absolute inequality, if 1 person does all deliveries, Just 1 family is infected and he risks all of them.

So yes there is a difference, this guy is unfortunately closer to the bad end of case scenario continuum, considering he's at the end of the bell curve, ie probably has most orders?",2020-04-20 16:12:10,-66,,/r/singapore/comments/g4o1n5/topearning_deliveroo_rider_in_spore_earned_s7095/

The tricky part about bell curve grading is that in order to get to the 99th percentile, you'll have to climb over a significant number of people. Being above-average isn't gonna do you much good since you'd still be stuck near the crest; you've gotta be god-like.

b0bbywasabi,"When I first started, Grabfood hasn’t launched yet, it was still Ubereats. I chose Panda simply because in my residential area, it was obvious panda was the dominant player at the time (there were much more panda riders compared to others). Normally riders would work in the neighbourhood where they live due to the familiarity. 

I think one major point most non-riders are not aware of is the flexibility of work. For roo and grab, they can simply turn on their app and their status will be online and they can start working for however long they want until they decide to log out and be offline. As for panda, you have to book shifts one week in advance and there are limited slots for different times throughout the day. You can’t just simply log in and be online to start work, and those shifts vary in duration. 

My observation during Circuit breaker, there was one weekend where there were many Grab riders with no orders because a whole bunch of them went online but there was not a proportionate demand for orders. For panda I feel that by having shifts it makes sure at each time of the day there is a certain number of riders to proportionately meet demand so it ensures when we work there are orders. But in terms of other normal days, if I can’t book shift, I lose out and can’t work whereas Grab and Roo riders have the most flexibility in this. 

In terms of earnings, it’s hard for me to say which platform you can earn more because I haven’t tried all of them. I can only say, I’ve been in the game long enough to experience 3 different types of services fee structures from foodpanda, namely: hourly + order, distance + order, and order based only. The latter is the current one and I feel it is the one which I have been earning the most.

,"Percentage based commission doesn’t make sense for the merchants. E.g let’s assume a 30% commission on a $10 order = $3 for Grab. But if the order is $100 then 25% commission = $25. Grab’s cost doesn’t change at all whether the order is $10 or $100 because it’s still one single rider doing the delivery, so what Grab is doing is losing money on the smaller orders in the hopes that they will have enough big orders to cover their losses. 

One solution is to move away from percentage based to a rate structure such as:
-	$X for orders $10 or below
-	$X*1.3 for orders between $10-$19.99
-	$X*1.6 for orders between $20-$29.99
and so on...

The main problem with delivery is that it’s always a value-losing proposition with small orders because of the disproportionately high percentage of cost to order value. At the same time, the majority of orders are small orders. This is not a problem that can be easily solved.",2020-05-09 10:08:55,-1,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

ngrenjie,"Your solution doesn’t seem that much different from a percentage-based commission structure. The cut is still based on the order amount. 

I agree with your analysis that smaller deliveries are not worth it, but look at it this way. Your delivery crew still have to be paid regardless of whether they are working or not. If you set the minimum order limit too high and too few people order, this means your manpower is seriously going under-utilised. 

One solution I can think of is if you can get customers to place their order way in advance, which may then give the company time to consolidate the orders and see how best to deploy their manpower. For example, perhaps the software could identify that 4 of the orders from say, Streats at BPP are going to families living in the same block. One driver could then be instructed to collect them all and deliver them all at one shot, rather than having 4 different people make 4 separate trips.

I doubt that the pizza place would pay their own delivery riders _less_ than the bigs.

OTOH, the actual value that GF/FP/Doo bring to the client resto *and* the paying customer is *discovery*, for which I can see paying the current markups — *once.* It would be interesting if one of the bigs were to rebrand themselves as a ""local restaurant discovery service"", admit up front that they take (the current cut) *for the first order*, with 1/3 to 1/2 the cut for subsequent orders from the same customer to the same client. I bet they'd do better than people seem to think. Would it be *enough* better to turn a sustainable profit? Probably not, but I wonder how those companies are less profitable here than in other countries (where labour costs are generally higher to boot)?",2020-05-09 03:42:00,3,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/
jdickey,"Just because their business models are unsustainable does not make them less predatory, at least in the sense that desperation is driving behaviour that *would* be considered predatory in profitable businesses.

I've called Grab an ""investor cash Grab"" several times before; it seems that nobody can make a real go of it here. Wondering how many hours it would take these guys to close up shop once the investor-cash free flow dried up. Seems like we had a few truly local brands that had that experience; perhaps the only thing that keeps the shell game going is that each of the surviving delivery services operates in so many countries?",2020-05-09 03:30:59,-4,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

stridered,"They don't care, the delivery riders are all considered individual contractors.  No orders to deliver means no payment to them.  

They love having an abundance of delivery riders because it means more orders can be fulfilled and it's harder for people to hit the incentives which means lesser payouts.",2020-05-09 12:28:52,2,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/
jmzyn,"Optimal route? That is total BS.
It’s more like slotting any additional order nearby and re-sorting the sequence after.

I’ll give you an example:
collect from Dhoby Ghaut, deliver to Somerset.
Then in between, they slot in an another order: collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton..

You would have thought, hey wow, one straight line... optimal! 
BUT their sequence WILL be re-sorted to collect from Dhoby Ghaut, collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton, deliver to Somerset just because you have to collect all your orders first before you start delivering. So if you are the customer waiting at Somerset, good luck to you. And even lagi good luck to you if Orchard is a long waiting queue BBT shop and customer at Newton decides to be pesky and not include their full address or pick up the rider’s call.

PS: it is their guideline to follow the sequence because you are supposed to update the app upon every collection, delivery action. So if suddenly, your delivery is at your door even when you did not receive that auto “your food is on the way” message, it’s most likely because the rider improvised at a risk of not adhering to their guidelines.",2020-05-09 08:36:21,18,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/
Varantain,"> Just remember to use your resto's own website to order when possible. I'd ordered a pizza or two a month through (the red one) before reading about the cut they and their competitors take on every order.

The crazy thing is that Pizza Hut has two prices even on their own website — different ones for dine-in/takeaway, and for delivery. The markup is about the same as ordering from a delivery app.",2020-05-09 05:59:47,3,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/
ngrenjie,"A lot of them have websites that are seriously CMI. I tried ordering McDonald’s using their own app and the experience was frankly terrible. Food came late and there were missing orders. Never had an issue with Grab. 

We can crap on the Foodpanda / deliveroo / Grabfood companies all we want, but the key reason why we keep going back to their apps is because they are so easy to use. I open the app, select the food I want, key in my address and make payment. Foodpanda and Deliveroo even support Apple Pay, which meant that for the longest time, I didn’t even need to key in my credit card details. 

It also means that I don’t need to have half a dozen restaurant apps or websites saved on my phone as well. 

If you ask me, it feels wasteful for each restaurant to manage their own delivery crew. From an efficiency standpoint, it makes more sense for something like this to be centralised so that the company can deploy manpower to whichever restaurant needs more support at any one time, allowing each eatery to focus solely on preparing their food.

Now, if only the economics of this can be worked out...",2020-05-09 11:07:21,5,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

jdickey,"Yeah, you're right. Web design here seems stuck in the late 1990s, particularly with regard to language support (the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/ws/languages) are probably still the gold standard here).

I also basically agree that having scores of different delivery fleets is wasteful and a business opportunity in its own right. Maybe, if the bigs don't make their payment scheme more sustainable for the restos and ethical for the customers, an association of restaurateurs could organise a cost-neutral delivery system. Order from whatever restaurant you like, either through their app or the association's, and the association's delivery drivers will get your food to your door.

Advantages over the current system:

* Delivery as a cost-neutral (commercial non-profit) service;
* Lower prices to the customer, and the ability for individual restaurants to experiment with their own promotions more than is presently done; and, not least
* Money made here stays here, and isn't spent on servicing the (all international) bigs' debt.

Doing a multilingual Web/phone app with modern tooling isn't as hard as the way most Singapore sites go about it, and so having an independent, *fully local* site/app with broad visibility and uptake would be a much-needed wake-up call to cheap-at-any-cost Singaporean businesses' Web sites. (20 years' Web development speaking here; the local Web environment is positively *enraging* to anybody who knows anything about modern standards. A good site drives engagement; that first *g* should never be an *r* in a consumer-driven industry.)",2020-05-09 17:33:22,2,,/r/singapore/comments/gfux0i/zaobao_grabfood_charges_merchants_2530_commission/

jmzyn,"I am not totally against that provided their algorithm is tuned properly such that the sequence is really along the way. Right now, they are just slotting the additional orders nearby and you can get examples like what I listed above. That is not optimal. Does it convenience the rider? NO. and we take a small hit on the commissions ($1) just because their algorithm thinks that it is along the way. We travel even longer on the road with less $. And it gets competitive out there, beggars can't be choosers in this current climate situation. We know we know, suck it up.

But at the same time, they gotta let customers like you know because some impatient customers would flip at the slightest of delays. ""why is the rider taking bloody long to deliver my food from just across the street? it has gone all cold by the time they deliver. even my grandma can do better!""
