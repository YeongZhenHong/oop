"Ya grab has changed a lot. Used to be that they would offer up vouchers and refunds easily. 

Nowadays, machiam have to beg them for a refund when it’s their driver or service partner’s fault.",304,2020-11-30,15:04:09

"Is foodpanda's template reply employing some sort of psychological trick that potentially turn one's anger into confusion / amusement in an effort to make u go eerrrrrrr and stop pursuing the matter?

Throw in a random ""DID YOU KNOW??"" for extra potency so the angry customer maybe will go ""really mehhhhh??"" then become distracted, hit up Google for some fact checking instead of complaining further. 

Before the person knows it, it's already 2am and they are on the weird part of YouTube learning about toenails art.

"I once ordered from deliveroo but forgot to enter the unit number (there's no specific field for unit number, you have to enter it into special instructions), so the driver just marked it as delivered and threw away the food when he couldn't find the unit...

Luckily they refunded us, but man, what a waste of food",65,2020-11-30,16:26:59
"Top 10 reasons why Grab is awful. 

They burned through so much cash in the early days giving away vouchers and getting the drivers to jump ship. Now not sustainable have to resort to stuff liddat. 

If they keep capturing the market, things will only go further south from here in terms of customer satisfaction.",50,2020-11-30,16:00:55
"My experience agrees.

Deliveroo reply fast and refund immediately; grab forever is still pending investigation.

"I have to say, all three have sucked at various points in time. 

Deliveroo has, more than once, not delivered orders because they could not find riders. They just kept changing the estimated arrival time until we cancelled (I’m talking teatime stuff for office ordered at 2pm that hasn’t arrived after 4pm and they still have no rider).

Foodpanda makes it insanely difficult to find the help chat, and then they go in these logical loops and keep doing stupid shit. Shit so stupid i was convinced the guy on the other side was a bot. And every time we disconnected because my screen locked while waiting for a reply, I got a new dumbass and had to repeat myself over and over. I usually only get a refund after I’ve wasted more than an hour. (Eg Foodpanda placed an order at a restaurant that was closed and replaced by a totally different restaurant, this was discovered by my rider who went to pick up the order and realised there was no such shop, and the customer service guy assured me my order would be delivered, called the rider and told him to go back, and called the ex employee of the restaurant and told him to prepare the order. When the rider called me back again I had to repeat my story. Took nearly 2 hours on the phone to get my $30 back). But they are often cheaper than grab.

Grab was only good because they had vouchers that drove down the cost of delivery. Once the vouchers are gone probably won’t use it except for self pickup.",9,2020-11-30,19:52:28
"McD should just use taller cups for the hot drinks and not fill them up to the brim. Some Indian Muslim stalls tie teh tarik in a takeaway plastic bag and pack it together with an empty cup.

Speaking from experience, I sometimes just hang it over my bike handle for short distances for the best results. LOL. Because no matter how well I fasten it inside the bag, there's bound to be spillage just because I went over a hump or got accidentally knocked about. 

same for some restaurants selling soup.",12,2020-11-30,16:58:06
"I've always preferred Deliveroo. They reply very quickly on the help chat, which I love. They're more intuitive.

As for Foodpanda, when I worked in the CBD, my colleagues and I tried them 3 times. First time: delivery was late by over 2 hours and got the order partially wrong. Second time: we ordered at 10am and they delivered at 1pm, again getting the order partially wrong. Third time was the same. We then abandoned them completely.

Grab is bleh but good example of market penetration pricing strategy.",5,2020-12-01,02:11:50

"The worst is when you order from a restaurant for multiple people, only get half the items cause theyre “out of stock”, but nope they dont call you or let you cancel the order because “theyve already started preparing it”.

"I had a good experience with Grab though. On 9 September midnight, I ordered Grab Premium. The app showed that the fare was $30. When I had arrived at home, my card was billed $40.

"Agreed man. Grab support totally sucks. Today I had an order which supposed to deliver to my house but then the delivery address was some other random address. I called grab support and they said they cannot refund the order or at least restore the promo code I used. They will only be able to refund if their so called technical side is able to confirm there was a GPS glitch or something.

They told the rider to dispose of the food. Free meal for him I guess.",1,2020-12-01,10:46:08
Grabs pretty useless when it comes to support. Ordered some curry dish and only the rice/meat arrived. They ended up siding with the restaurant and gave me a one dollar voucher on a 25 dollar order. Stopped using them ever since,1,2020-12-01,18:08:05
"I have an unpleasant experience with Grabfood before but I felt that we were partly at fault so I did not pursue any further. But posting here because I'm curious to know if anyone has any 2 cents on whether Grab should be refunding us in our case.
Basically I helped my aunt order food via her Grab app for about 3 pax so it is a considerable amount of food. Address input was not fully complete (no unit number) and because my aunt is new to this whole food ordering thing she did not monitor her phone at all after we placed the order. Delivery man called twice, she did not hear her phone to pick it up. Around 10min passed before we realised and by then the whole transaction had been cancelled from Grab's end and there was no way we could call the delivery man back. Food did not arrive at all and Grab refused to give us refund. Thoughts? Should they have done so out of goodwill? Afterall we made payment for food that we did not receive at all. But on the other hand it is because we did not provide the full address.",1,2020-12-01,19:19:39

Yea, some grab driver charged me 10 dollar extra( on a 10 dollar trip) because he picked me up in the basement condo(the address I typed...) and I had the galls to tell him to drop me in the basement of another condo (the address I typed...)

Grab pretty much replied with a premade message and told me to suck it.Not worth the hassle to try to call them by person, I just decided to use grab less, will still suck them dry when they have promos.",40,2020-11-30,15:49:13

I told Foodpanda. They called the rider and the ex employee of the restaurant and insisted that my order would be delivered. I nearly hit the roof. 

Ya, it was a lot of time wasted of like $30. But after a while the money is not the point. Not being cheated is the point.",14,2020-11-30,19:44:46

App set delivery to location A (approx 1km away) but comments input delivery to location B (approx 10km away) for a fare of $5. And I'm riding a bicycle, no way was I gonna cycle 10km.

Don't think mine was a glitch but a mistake on the customer's end. Called Grab support and they told me to deliver to location A even when I knew the customer (which I had also contacted to confirm delivery location) was at location B. I went through the standard motion, wait 5-10 min and disposed of the food.

Another Grab support staff did call me when I was already at location A and said the customer called and asked if I could return the food back to the restaurant while Grab re-assigns the delivery to a motorcyclist. 

Funny how they didn't try to resolve that when I was still at the restaurant and on the line with Grab support. They didn't want to compensate me for making another trip back so yea I rejected it.

&#x200B;

Oh yea, customer was lucky it was a cash delivery order. So he didn't lose any $ or had to clawback anything from Grab. I was the sucker who had to waste over 15min on the line waiting and getting instructions and seeking clawback from Grab, which they did.",1,2020-12-01,12:30:58

"Just a theory, might be because your subscription signals a 'loyalty' to the app. You are likely already using it enough or have opted to pay, and therefore it takes less effort / costs less to keep you on. On the other hand, people not subscribed are not as loyal, and thus they throw more discounts to try to get them using the app to build up loyalty...

"Going to have to check if they increase the prices for pickup (pro vs non-pro users.) 

I mainly use pandapro for the additional 5% pickup discount. Pickup at certain stalls is much cheaper than ordering at the stall itself and you can beat the queue. For delivery, I only go for free delivery options with minimum purchase of $15 instead of a % discount since the delivery fee waiver is often much better.

Not saying that foodpanda is good (their customer service is horrible and I have had delivery delays) but they are more reliable than grabfood imo.",2,2021-03-16,01:14:23

"Imagine you're Grab. FoodPanda and Deliveroo has been around for years but now you want a slice of the food delivery pie. 

So you do what you did with private hire services back when Uber was around. You cut crazy ass deals to the public in order to gain market share. Remember it began with an $8 a month subscription plan (30 deliveries, free $5 & $10 voucher and no minimum order!).

I've worked as a delivery rider before so I can tell you we can about $6 - $8 per drop (this can go even higher in certain places in town). 

And so imagine if you ordered a $10 meal. 30% goes to Grab for its fees - that's $3. But on top of that, Grab has to pay $6 - $8 to the rider who delivered your food to you. Now that's negative $3 - $5. Add in the support staff, the data scientists that are responsible for the algorithms and other staff at Grab's HQ, you can imagine that subscription plan is really not a sustainable one.

It was never meant to be around forever. It's only goal was to gain market share and monopolise the food delivery market in terms of both customers and riders (so many people have gone over from Panda/Kangaroo).

And the COVID-19 crisis was just a catalyst. Higher demand and people willing to pay extra fees. 

No, I do not work for Grab and i'm not some Grab-fanatic. 

In fact, while as a food delivery rider in the past (for Panda) i benefitted from the price wars, I thought it was really stupid delivering $6.50 foods when I was getting $8 for it.

Just thought even as a consumer, if we aspire to be savvy, we have to look both sides of the picture, not just ours.

"This view is rather entitled. Food delivery is not a necessity (save for exceptions - those physically or otherwise impaired). Grab/deliveroo are private enterprises, not a charity. Just because you may have used their services before doesn't mean they owe you anything.

"Contrary to popular belief, this is a money losing business and the increase in customers isn't necessarily translating into profits. The Wall Street Journal had an article about it: [America Is Stuck at Home, but Food-Delivery Companies Still Struggle to Profit ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-is-stuck-at-home-but-food-delivery-companies-still-struggle-to-profit-11589374801).

> Sales for Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash Inc. and Postmates Inc. are growing, according to the companies and credit-card data.

> But increased costs to fund promotions and safety equipment on one hand, and pressure to reduce commissions for strapped restaurants on the other, have created an even worse financial proposition for food-delivery companies.

It's likely the situation is similar in Singapore.",6,2020-05-17,15:07:04
"Unpopular opinion - I think what they are doing is necessary.

The simple reality is that for all their size, none of them are profitable because their costs scale in line with the number of customers they service. This isn’t like Google or telcos where their costs are fixed in nature (ie: server / infrastructure costs), and marginal cost of serving each additional user is close to zero. 

With food delivery companies, they have no such benefit. Each additional order means they need to assign an extra rider to bring that food to your doorstep (and pay that rider), so there is really no economies of scale to be had here. 

As such, the irony here is that more people ordering food online actually means bigger losses for these companies. And the only way to stem these losses is to charge higher prices. They can’t take a higher cut from the restaurants than they already are, so that leaves the consumer in the form of higher fees and / or minimum orders. 

Under normal circumstances, competition is likely stiff enough, and the orders so few that the food delivery companies won’t dare to do such a thing. Right now, there are probably enough people using their services that these companies are comfortable raising prices. Yes, some might get turned off by this (but who are you going to switch to really), but there would still be enough customers left who are willing to pay their higher asking prices. 

That’s just my take at least. They are firing their worst customers, defined as those who are not earning them any money. And I don’t blame them. I believe that one side-effect of this pandemic is the acceleration of existing trends, and given the current lack of profitability of these food delivery companies, it felt inevitable really.",26,2020-05-17,12:01:05
"Tbh I don't blame businesses for exploiting this opportunity to pump up their profits. They need to continue operations and in the end the employees benefit too.

BUT I freaking hate it when they pretend to be all warm and cuddly as if they are doing all the good in the world. Example is Grab coming up with that social media post about how they are helping everyone else and barely have profits.

Their main business, the grab car grab share that wing, can't earn them money because of this virus. Of course they have to balance it out by making grab food more profitable.

You think food delivery charity ah. Just like flights when demand goes up the price also goes up.,2,2020-05-17,15:00:56
"Think about it this way, the general customer base been benefiting from their services prior to this. Prior to CB, cheaper delivery + greater convenience(vs what the market provided) was gained from using their service, which came at the cost of Grab's equity. Someone was paying for the benefit customers accrued.

So right now they are trying to head at least towards the direction of breaking even by raising prices. On top of that, the companies have loss a lot of goodwill(hard to quantify but valuable) with their customers. I believe the market will vote with their wallets on this.

Maybe this can even settle this experiment that transport/delivery prices have found its equilibrium. Maybe all along, there is always going to be that large gap in, prices people are willing to provide delivery/transport, vs prices people are willing to pay for that service.",2,2020-05-17,19:58:40

Anyone with any common sense on how businesses profit would understand that giving 50 free deliveries each month to a customer would result in 150 bucks spent/ loss to the firm. They in turn might pass this cost  on to the food vendors or the delivery riders (in the form of lower incentives for example).

"$14.50 service fee is ridiculous, but who am I to criticise the consumer if they are willing to pay that much? Though the last few times I checked the grab app, their delivery fee has largely remained constant at $3 to $3.50, so this higher pricing might be confined to certain areas with higher volume of orders. 

So yay for living in a more ulu portion of Bukit Panjang? 😛 

I am currently on a Foodpanda monthly plan, where I pay $8 a month for 15 free deliveries (and I used all 15 last billing cycle, for a savings of $37). My mom and I don’t cook, so on other occasions, we either get food from the coffee shop downstairs (and supplement with canned food), or eat bread / instant noodles. 

I am going to assume that Foodpanda absorbs the cost of this promotion. My orders range from $18 (Wok hey) to $30 (Flaming Don) for two people, so I estimate that Foodpanda is not really earning all that much from me. 

The article you linked to also has some inconsistencies. Since Grab is the company handling the payment processing, they will likely be the ones to absorb the credit card fees as well (and I suspect their use of paylater is a bid to cut down on processing fees by consolidating all the receipts into one lump sum). 

But yeah, I did switch from Grabfood back to Foodpanda early this year when Grab significantly cut back on their promotions, and their use of paylater meant I am not able to benefit from my credit card rewards the same way I do with Foodpanda.

"Hmm extremely good points. My thinking was along the line of, if they provide the subscription previously when deliveries weren’t as high a demand, why would they remove it when demand is up and they’re presumably earning more? Unless I’m retarded and they’re actually making a loss from the increased demand in deliveries. I mean it’s nice for companies to have a little empathy for the small group of people but that’s in an idealistic world which we’re clearly not in. Definitely don’t have the intention to bring down the business. 

I admit, i might be taking it a little personally. I have always been a huge fan of grab and have been supporting them since the start, loyal to 3 subscriptions, 1 being the free delivery even when I didn’t need to deliver as much before the CB. However it’s kind of frustrating for right now as I have to serve SHN, thanks ns! So when I actually had more use for the coupons, they came and remove it. Adding salt onto wound, delivery fees has steeply been increased. What was $4 before CB is now suddenly at $8. I wouldn’t be this frustrated if I had the choice to opt for pick up.

1) Restaurants are not overloaded. They have lost over 50% of business, and hence they are providing extended delivery to increase sales. Grab is charging upwards of 30% commission to restaurants , thereby leading restaurants to lower profit % to increase sales in order to pay their employees. So it is grabs profit again

"Ehhh it's either illegal or not, not halfway. And what's your basis for alleging bad faith? They never cheat you of your money what.

For both Grab and Deliveroo, there are clear clauses reserving the right to change the benefits under the subscription plans subject to notice being given by email or in-app prior to implementation (for Deliveroo) and notices given via email it in-app two billing cycles beforehand (for Grab). 

Both services also clearly reserve the right of termination at their discretion, and you are also not charged if the subscription is cancelled. You also have an ongoing month by month subscription and as consumer you are also entitled to cancel at any time (within a billing cycle). Not unreasonable right?

These clauses are pretty prominently displayed in the short summarised version of Grab's T&C, and is the third and forth bullet point under the first clause you see for Deliveroo Plus. They gave you prior notice, how is it bad faith? 

If you never read the T&Cs because you blindly click that you did and subscribe, **that's on you**. If you never check your email and missed the notice or dismissed the in-app notification, that's also on you. Deliveroo's terms entitle you to cancel with immediate effect after you receive a notice of change, and you get a refund of what you paid for that month. It's a fair exchange between willing buyer, willing seller.

Also, why you personal attack against people's family sia. That's kinda low blow.",5,2020-05-17,19:44:25

You can’t facilitate a meaningful discussion if everything needs to somehow tunnel-vision to your main point.

That aside, let me address your main point. I assume you know about supply and demand. Since the demand is spiking, if they kept everything at the status quo, it wouldn’t make sense to their shareholders, the people who invest money in the company. Given that Grab isn’t a running a charity, and is profit-oriented, why wouldn’t they increase delivery fees to make more money? You can feel free to boycott them, but they’re not doing anything wrong.

Addressing your ‘extended logic’, it isn’t very logical. Grab isn’t monopolising life-saving insulin, or something you cannot live without. If restaurants increase prices to a point where you can’t afford it, feel free to cook at home. They have access to cooking utensils and ingredients, and so do you. They have heat with which to cook, and arms with which to use, and so do you. This is wholly different from growing your own veggies. You can reasonably be expected to cook your own food, but no one is expecting you to grow vegetables at a sufficient rate, nor do you have the land available to do so.

There's 8000 cases out of 6million population, very conservative estimate 1 infected out of 750. This doesn't even count the asymptomatic people who might outnumber that 8000 by 2-3 times. 

He's very likely to have visited a family with symptomatic person by the end of the month once. virus hops on him, he's asymptomatic, but shares it with the rest of the 1000 families he meets.

>So he, and by extension of your reasoning, all delivery men should not be out delivering food? And food parcels, and groceries etc?

He shouldn't be doing the numbers he's doing.

Many of us aren't meeting friends anymore, its to cut down on the number of people that could possibly be infected. Don't do what's unnecessary.

Delivering food is necessary, but exploiting the high period to make a buck is wholly irresponsible.

>He’s doing his job to help us get food, you don’t think he deserves the money?

>Are you jelly about the money he earns?

Deserves? Sure he does. For the labour he's putting in, of course he deserves to be properly compensated. He has to be working 70-80 hour weeks to get there.

Jelly? perhaps. But not for the money, but the lack of responsibility he has shown. He can earn all he wants with little care, he risks himself and his customers, but since government is paying for his medical bills if he does get infected, why would he stop the cashflow?

There are certainly other ways of making extra cash a month that doesnt endanger the lives of others.

>If x number if people visits your house to provide food, What difference does it make if x is by the same person?

>If y number of customers dial for food, what is the difference if 100% of y deliveries were made by the same version vs made by z number of people?

Best case scenario, little clustering occurs. Viral cases are restricted to linked families. This occurs when delivery orders to persistent families are equally spread amongst all deliveryman to reduce house-to-house contamination.

Realistic scenario, small clustering occurs tied to 1 deliveryman visiting affected family then moving on. This occurs when uneven distribution of orders, that 1 guy gets more orders than others -> visit more families -> more chances of visiting someone infected -> more families visit and infect by virtue of having more orders. Of course this is a portion luck as well, as the casual deliveryman with less orders may be the one who has to visit the infected family, and cluster is small, but probability again is smaller than above.

Worst case scenario. 1 big cluster. Absolute inequality, if 1 person does all deliveries, Just 1 family is infected and he risks all of them.

So yes there is a difference, this guy is unfortunately closer to the bad end of case scenario continuum, considering he's at the end of the bell curve, ie probably has most orders?",-70,2020-04-20,16:12:10

The tricky part about bell curve grading is that in order to get to the 99th percentile, you'll have to climb over a significant number of people. Being above-average isn't gonna do you much good since you'd still be stuck near the crest; you've gotta be god-like.

"When I first started, Grabfood hasn’t launched yet, it was still Ubereats. I chose Panda simply because in my residential area, it was obvious panda was the dominant player at the time (there were much more panda riders compared to others). Normally riders would work in the neighbourhood where they live due to the familiarity. 

I think one major point most non-riders are not aware of is the flexibility of work. For roo and grab, they can simply turn on their app and their status will be online and they can start working for however long they want until they decide to log out and be offline. As for panda, you have to book shifts one week in advance and there are limited slots for different times throughout the day. You can’t just simply log in and be online to start work, and those shifts vary in duration. 

My observation during Circuit breaker, there was one weekend where there were many Grab riders with no orders because a whole bunch of them went online but there was not a proportionate demand for orders. For panda I feel that by having shifts it makes sure at each time of the day there is a certain number of riders to proportionately meet demand so it ensures when we work there are orders. But in terms of other normal days, if I can’t book shift, I lose out and can’t work whereas Grab and Roo riders have the most flexibility in this. 

In terms of earnings, it’s hard for me to say which platform you can earn more because I haven’t tried all of them. I can only say, I’ve been in the game long enough to experience 3 different types of services fee structures from foodpanda, namely: hourly + order, distance + order, and order based only. The latter is the current one and I feel it is the one which I have been earning the most.

"Percentage based commission doesn’t make sense for the merchants. E.g let’s assume a 30% commission on a $10 order = $3 for Grab. But if the order is $100 then 25% commission = $25. Grab’s cost doesn’t change at all whether the order is $10 or $100 because it’s still one single rider doing the delivery, so what Grab is doing is losing money on the smaller orders in the hopes that they will have enough big orders to cover their losses. 

One solution is to move away from percentage based to a rate structure such as:
-	$X for orders $10 or below
-	$X*1.3 for orders between $10-$19.99
-	$X*1.6 for orders between $20-$29.99
and so on...

The main problem with delivery is that it’s always a value-losing proposition with small orders because of the disproportionately high percentage of cost to order value. At the same time, the majority of orders are small orders. This is not a problem that can be easily solved.",-1,2020-05-09,10:08:55
"A GrabFood cyclist gets about $5/delivery. So if your delivery fee is $3-4, GrabFood tops up $2-1 of the XX% to the cyclist. So it makes perfect sense they introduced the minimum order value otherwise they would be bleeding for a $5 food order delivery.

They’ve also been adding more “along the way” jobs to delivery so the overall topup gets even lower. 2x typical $5/jobs suddenly becomes 1x $9/2jobs.

A cyclist needs to travel to restaurant A, wait and collect, then restaurant B, wait and collect before delivering to customer A and then customer B or the other way round.",15,2020-05-09,00:20:29

"Your solution doesn’t seem that much different from a percentage-based commission structure. The cut is still based on the order amount. 

I agree with your analysis that smaller deliveries are not worth it, but look at it this way. Your delivery crew still have to be paid regardless of whether they are working or not. If you set the minimum order limit too high and too few people order, this means your manpower is seriously going under-utilised. 

One solution I can think of is if you can get customers to place their order way in advance, which may then give the company time to consolidate the orders and see how best to deploy their manpower. For example, perhaps the software could identify that 4 of the orders from say, Streats at BPP are going to families living in the same block. One driver could then be instructed to collect them all and deliver them all at one shot, rather than having 4 different people make 4 separate trips. 

This would mean that the company doesn’t need to hire as many delivery people, which may cut down on their costs.",-1,2020-05-09,10:58:10

"Just remember to use your resto's own website to order when possible. I'd ordered a pizza or two a month through (the red one) before reading about the cut they and their competitors take on every order. I doubt that the pizza place would pay their own delivery riders _less_ than the bigs.

OTOH, the actual value that GF/FP/Doo bring to the client resto *and* the paying customer is *discovery*, for which I can see paying the current markups — *once.* It would be interesting if one of the bigs were to rebrand themselves as a ""local restaurant discovery service"", admit up front that they take (the current cut) *for the first order*, with 1/3 to 1/2 the cut for subsequent orders from the same customer to the same client. I bet they'd do better than people seem to think. Would it be *enough* better to turn a sustainable profit? Probably not, but I wonder how those companies are less profitable here than in other countries (where labour costs are generally higher to boot)?",3,2020-05-09,03:42:00

Wondering how many hours it would take these guys to close up shop once the investor-cash free flow dried up.

"They don't care, the delivery riders are all considered individual contractors.  No orders to deliver means no payment to them.  

They love having an abundance of delivery riders because it means more orders can be fulfilled and it's harder for people to hit the incentives which means lesser payouts.",2,2020-05-09,12:28:52
"Optimal route? That is total BS.
It’s more like slotting any additional order nearby and re-sorting the sequence after.

I’ll give you an example:
collect from Dhoby Ghaut, deliver to Somerset.
Then in between, they slot in an another order: collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton..

You would have thought, hey wow, one straight line... optimal! 
BUT their sequence WILL be re-sorted to collect from Dhoby Ghaut, collect from Orchard, deliver to Newton, deliver to Somerset just because you have to collect all your orders first before you start delivering. So if you are the customer waiting at Somerset, good luck to you. And even lagi good luck to you if Orchard is a long waiting queue BBT shop and customer at Newton decides to be pesky and not include their full address or pick up the rider’s call.

PS: it is their guideline to follow the sequence because you are supposed to update the app upon every collection, delivery action. So if suddenly, your delivery is at your door even when you did not receive that auto “your food is on the way” message, it’s most likely because the rider improvised at a risk of not adhering to their guidelines.",17,2020-05-09,08:36:21
"> Just remember to use your resto's own website to order when possible. I'd ordered a pizza or two a month through (the red one) before reading about the cut they and their competitors take on every order.

"A lot of them have websites that are seriously CMI. I tried ordering McDonald’s using their own app and the experience was frankly terrible. Food came late and there were missing orders. Never had an issue with Grab. 

We can crap on the Foodpanda / deliveroo / Grabfood companies all we want, but the key reason why we keep going back to their apps is because they are so easy to use. I open the app, select the food I want, key in my address and make payment. Foodpanda and Deliveroo even support Apple Pay, which meant that for the longest time, I didn’t even need to key in my credit card details. 

It also means that I don’t need to have half a dozen restaurant apps or websites saved on my phone as well. 

If you ask me, it feels wasteful for each restaurant to manage their own delivery crew. From an efficiency standpoint, it makes more sense for something like this to be centralised so that the company can deploy manpower to whichever restaurant needs more support at any one time, allowing each eatery to focus solely on preparing their food.

Now, if only the economics of this can be worked out...",7,2020-05-09,11:07:21
"Grab has not increased the commission during this period, and is waiving the on boarding fee as well.

"Yeah, you're right. Web design here seems stuck in the late 1990s, particularly with regard to language support (the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/ws/languages) are probably still the gold standard here).

I also basically agree that having scores of different delivery fleets is wasteful and a business opportunity in its own right. Maybe, if the bigs don't make their payment scheme more sustainable for the restos and ethical for the customers, an association of restaurateurs could organise a cost-neutral delivery system. Order from whatever restaurant you like, either through their app or the association's, and the association's delivery drivers will get your food to your door.

Advantages over the current system:

* Delivery as a cost-neutral (commercial non-profit) service;
* Lower prices to the customer, and the ability for individual restaurants to experiment with their own promotions more than is presently done; and, not least
* Money made here stays here, and isn't spent on servicing the (all international) bigs' debt.

Doing a multilingual Web/phone app with modern tooling isn't as hard as the way most Singapore sites go about it, and so having an independent, *fully local* site/app with broad visibility and uptake would be a much-needed wake-up call to cheap-at-any-cost Singaporean businesses' Web sites. (20 years' Web development speaking here; the local Web environment is positively *enraging* to anybody who knows anything about modern standards. A good site drives engagement; that first *g* should never be an *r* in a consumer-driven industry.)",2,2020-05-09,17:33:22

"I am not totally against that provided their algorithm is tuned properly such that the sequence is really along the way. Right now, they are just slotting the additional orders nearby and you can get examples like what I listed above. That is not optimal. Does it convenience the rider?

And it gets competitive out there, beggars can't be choosers in this current climate situation. We know we know, suck it up.

But at the same time, they gotta let customers like you know because some impatient customers would flip at the slightest of delays. ""why is the rider taking bloody long to deliver my food from just across the street? it has gone all cold by the time they deliver. even my grandma can do better!""

Once I'm halfway to the customer's location then I will turn on the other one and accept any orders that come in.

"Just received an e-mail from them, looks like they moved it forward.

Here's the e-mail I got:

>**Changes to your fees** From today, you’ll begin to see a ‘minimum spend’ of $18 displayed for Plus free delivery in-app. Your subscription means that you don't pay any delivery fee, as long as the order meets the minimum spend for that restaurant - no matter how far the delivery is or how often you order.

For those that order for a family or with their partners, this isn't going to make a huge difference. Your average order for 2 people via Deliveroo is going to be $25 at the very least.

This however, does impact anyone that orders just for one like people living by themselves or with flatmates. $18 for one person for a single meal is pretty high.

This is probably a strategy to remove exactly those people from their subscription base and focus on bigger margins for themselves with less orders rather than razor thin margins (or negative) with low order values.

Overall, Plus subscribers that are single or order for one:

1. Cancel their subscription out of annoyance and order with FoodPanda or GrabFood and pay the same delivery fee. Those guys have more inventory / restaurants on their apps.
2. Those that are living with flatmates probably have one or more people subscribed, so all but one will keep their subscription and they'll end up ordering together.
3. Order lunch and dinner together. Keep dinner, heat it up later.",11,2020-05-01,19:00:15
"I see it as inevitable. Delivery costs are a fixed cost (because you pay your delivery crew), while the revenue they get from each order depends on how much the customer orders. This is probably the only way they can break even, and I am guessing that they dare to do it because grab is already implementing it, and for all we know, foodpanda may not be far behind.",19,2020-05-01,20:07:10
"Grabfood rider here. Deliveroo pays the most to its rider. Double and sometimes triple of what the other 2 companies pay.  
  
Deliveroo is popular in the central region but for the neighbourhood region, you'll be lucky to get 1 deliveroo order in 4 hours. Some riders will keep deliveroo's app on while working for the other 2 companies.  
  
It comes as no surprise that they are facing problems now. They have a very niche market because their list of merchants are mostly atas, central based and expensive. With offices closed in CBD, they probably lose the core group of their customers.",6,2020-05-02,06:49:22

They're struggling so much that they even had to [lay off](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/deliveroo-lays-off-25-of-singapore-staff-amid-covid-19-economic-downturn) 25% of their Singapore corporate office staff, so I we can hardly fault them for trying improve their unit economics.",-2,2020-05-01,23:12:21

>  
>What would be genuine is that if a corporation, a solely economic entity, did nothing for civil rights, but the CEO and other top brass donated their personal funds to whatever cause they personally support.

They faced losing friends or being ostracised just because they liked someone of the same gender, they faced rejection from family members, they feared travelling to certain countries, and above all, they knew they could never get the same kind of privileges that straight people enjoy,, both the legal kind and the unconscious, everyday thing that we take for granted.

So a company expressing their support for LGBT peoples? That's honestly relatively new. Sure, it may be virtue signalling. Sure, it may just be for the pink dollar.

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkwashing\_(LGBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkwashing_(LGBT))

&#x200B;

**Pinkwashing** is a portmanteau word which combines ""pink"" and ""whitewashing"". The term is most often used to describe various forms of cause marketing. ...**Pinkwashing** (LGBT) – the promotion of the gay-friendliness of a corporate or political entity **in an attempt to downplay or soften aspects of it considered negative.**

&#x200B;

now, why is deliveroo pinkwashing? maybe it has to do with its exploitative practices wrt classifying its riders as independent contractors (for reference, the employment tribunal lawsuit in the UK) to cut costs and deny them traditional employment protections.

&#x200B;

nothing wrong with individuals turning up for gay pride. but corporations - particularly irresponsible ones like deliveroo - can fuck off.",13,2019-06-07,02:09:12
"Speak for yourself. Homosexuality is not even legal in Singapore and you’re talking as if everyone is accepting of LGBT people and the companies are just bigots for spreading awareness. It’s the bare minimum Singapore companies can do for LGBT and it’s not like they can contribute anything more since the government actively bans everything that is LGBT related. 

They changed to a rainbow icon and suddenly it “preys on younger people’s pocket”. So are you saying that no company should never promote LGBT awareness because everything they do is not for the benefits of the LGBT people? So how do you suggest Singapore get the words out when the government is censoring anything LGBT related? 

Do this also cannot, do that also cannot. I for one happy that they are still people fight for LGBT rights. Since you are so high and mighty, what did you contribute besides criticising them?",4,2019-06-07,01:55:11

It’s basically giving up your autonomy and saying, the moral trends are what they are, leave them be. I think the impact on all of us is too significant to be leaving something this important up to chance or the trend of the day.

My perspective on human rights:
The freedom of the individual ends where it infringes on the freedom of society.

We don’t give people the “human right to murder” because it infringes on the right of others to life.

On the other hand, being gay doesn’t really infringe on the freedom of anyone else. It’s laughable that people think they should be allowed to dictate who someone else loves just because it makes them “uncomfortable”.

So in the cost benefit analysis I find it really hard to support gay discrimination.

The main arguments against being gay are basically religious ones, and I think they have a huge burden of proof of religion even being true to infringe so heavily on the freedom of someone else to love who they love.",5,2019-06-07,13:24:32

Deliveroo has stopped assigning food delivery orders to riders on  personal mobility devices (PMDs), as the zero-tolerance stance for the  electric scooter footpath ban kicked in yesterday.

Any existing PMD riders who have not switched vehicles or applied for  the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) e-scooter trade-in grant by the  deadline on Tuesday will not be able to continue working for Deliveroo  until ""they confirm they would like to switch vehicles"", said a  Deliveroo spokesman.

Two errant e-scooter users flouting the rules - one in Yishun and the  other in Sengkang - have been caught by enforcement officers, said the  LTA in a Facebook post yesterday evening. They could be fined up to  $2,000, jailed for up to three months, or both.

LTA enforcement officers were patrolling in areas such as Ang Mo Kio, Punggol, Sengkang, Sembawang and Yishun yesterday.

Besides taking strict enforcement action against errant e-scooter  users, the officers continued checks on active mobility devices to  ensure they complied with the authorities' safety criteria.

Under the new rules, users of e-scooters are banned from riding their  devices on the 5,500km of footpaths in Singapore. This means that the  use of e-scooters, which are already banned on roads, will be confined  to the 440km of cycling paths.

The footpath ban started on Nov 5, following a series of e-scooter-related accidents.

Up until  Tuesday, the authorities had been issuing warnings to errant riders,  but its zero-tolerance policy for the offence took effect yesterday.

Once crowded with PMDs, the footpaths around Compass One shopping  mall in Sengkang appeared to be devoid of e-scooters when The Straits  Times visited yesterday morning.

At least six LTA enforcement officers were patrolling the grounds.  But for three hours, ST did not see any e-scooters on footpaths and  roads around Compass One.

But it was a different story when ST visited Causeway Point in  Woodlands in the afternoon. No enforcement officers were in sight.

In 30 minutes, ST observed seven e-scooter users on footpaths. Three  were food delivery riders from Foodpanda and GrabFood and another three  were young riders who blasted music as they rode.

The last user was a mother ferrying her young daughter to tuition  class. She said she had no idea that the ban came into effect yesterday.

""Nobody told me. I thought it was banned only in May! Now that I  know, I will stop using my e-scooter,"" said Madam Huang, who declined to  give her full name.

Bicycles and personal mobility aids such as motorised wheelchairs are allowed on footpaths, cycling paths and park connectors.

But the ban will progressively be extended to other motorised PMDs in  the first quarter of this year, including hoverboards and unicycles.

All of the food delivery riders ST spoke to were aware of the  footpath ban. Some of them have swopped their e-scooters for bicycles,  power-assisted bicycles and motorcycles after the new rules were  announced last November.

Mr Zuraime Yangakub, who has been a full-time delivery rider for  GrabFood for six months, is one of them. He has been cycling for two  months and said he has lost 8.5kg since making the switch.

"Don’t need to read. Tbh banks don’t value or reward customer loyalty. Also, there is no one single card that can be optimised for personal expenditure. 

My thoughts, use a card for family expense and another for personal expense. As for cash back, aim for new cards reward. Most of the banks, especially international banks gives welcome rewards for new card holders. For example, HSBC gives $180 for $800 spending. That is like a 6 months of rebates assuming a 3% return on a 1k monthly spending, assuming you can optimise your spending to achieve a 3% returns. Standard chartered or AMEX gives similar amount in cash or in kinds (Apple Watch, ear pods). This is in comparison to $30 welcome gift for existing customers. How do you qualify as a new customer, you may ask. The definition for all banks are “non card holder for 12 months”. So if you cancel your card and reapply a new card 12 months later, you are considered a new customer. 

The plan, apply for a HS (or other banks cards), make the minimum spend and take the welcome gift, hold for 6 months and cancel it thereafter. Apply for the same card 12 months after.",11,2021-02-14,15:32:54

Your spending patterns may shift slightly from month to month, and as a result the ""perfect"" setup for that month may also be different. The fact for most people is that a couple of good cards including one that best rewards their heaviest spending category is good enough. Min-maxing is usually not worth it to squeeze out an extra 0.2% or something for all that extra effort.

When u think you can save $5 off every $100 deposit, you are not. U do not save $5, u spent $95 unnecessarily and subtlety. That will justify u into putting more n saving more next time because u ""experienced"" the benefit of $5 off per $100 afterall.

Take a step back. Without the deposit, u probably spend less as every transaction is being thought through, u spend only on the essentials.

There used to be a time when I was all-in on the grab ecosystem (using grab, Grabfood and paying with grabpay) because Grab was giving out discounts and vouchers like nobody’s business, and grabpoints could be further redeemed for fairly attractive rewards (roughly 2.7% rebate).

"> # Impossible Foods' plant-based 'meat' available on Deliveroo from May 21

> SINGAPORE — Vegans, vegetarians and those who have a taste for plant-based food items may soon have more choices when ordering meals online.

> From May 21, food delivery company Deliveroo is partnering exclusively with American food company Impossible Foods to offer dishes and meals made from its plant-based products.

> They will be on the menu of eight restaurant brands with a total of 33 outlets in Singapore, namely Fatboy’s the Burger Bar, FatPapas, Omakase Burger, Oriole Coffee + Bar, PappaRich, PS Cafe, Three Buns, and Wolf Burger.

> Impossible Foods develops meat alternatives made from plants.

> Deliveroo’s general manager Siddharth Shanker said: “We’ve seen a surge in demand for vegan or plant-based options in the past couple of years.”

> Orders from vegetarian or vegan restaurants on its platform have gone up from 7 per cent in 2017 to 10 per cent in January this year.

> Diners in Singapore have also been receptive to Impossible Foods’ meat substitutes so far, Deliveroo said.

> Impossible Foods launched its plant-based meat in Singapore earlier in March by partnering eight restaurants, including Potato Head, Bread Street Kitchen by Gordon Ramsey and Cut by Wolfgang Puck.

> The restaurants serve dishes containing the kosher and halal-certified “beef” from Impossible Foods.

> Deliveroo noted that four restaurants have seen a 15 per cent average increase in patrons since they started serving dishes from Impossible Foods.

> Mr Shanker said: “Introducing Impossible Foods on Deliveroo fits our strategy to offer more plant-based foods with a lower environmental impact.”

> Impossible Foods is known for its Impossible Burger, made primarily from soy and potato proteins, coconut oil and sunflower oil.

> The company genetically modifies yeast and uses fermentation to produce an iron-containing molecule called heme, which creates the flavour of meat and gives the patty its red colour.

> The Impossible Burger is said to be more environment-friendly than one with a conventional ground beef patty, as it requires less water and land to produce while emitting less greenhouse gases and water pollutants.

> On the latest development, Impossible Foods’ director of international launches Jordan Sadowsky said: “With nearly half of global meat consumption coming from Asia, it’s been a priority for us to find more ways to expand in the region.”

"Not sure for impossible food's patties but I think beyond burger's patties are available in certain NTUC. Although they go for a whopping of $12.50 (2 patty). Essentially $6.25 per vegan patty.

I like the idea of their 'saving meat, saving earth' notion but I think it's abit too much for those kinds of pricetag. Yes I do understand that it's alot of work and all for them to come up with it but from doing some simple research, it seems like they've been having and getting alot of support and funding so it really baffles me as to why their stuff are/going to be priced so premiumly? Is it because of novelty? Wanting to replace traditional meat with 'meat' shouldn't actually cost the end-user/consumer an arm or an leg if the goal in the first place was to be green earth. 

I've tried it and really love it but if i were to be real honest, I probably wouldn't replace my diet or wallet's health for this, mainly due to the absurd pricetag. Which in turn, defeats the purpose of them creating this in the first place as they want people to stop consuming meat and use their product instead for replacement.",3,2019-05-16,19:26:21

It isn't applicable towards replacement of something with more structure, like steak.

If we think about climate change in general, I think that moving away from beef into chicken and farmed fish is far more environmentally friendly.

> SINGAPORE: An electric-scooter rider on his way to deliver food to a customer collided with a three-year-old boy in a corridor of a mall in Serangoon, causing the child to fall backwards.

> Neo Jia Ming, 20, who was a Deliveroo rider back then, collided into the child outside a shop on the fourth level of Nex Mall on Mar 18.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Neo, who was also serving national service at the time, pleaded guilty on Thursday (Jun 27) to one charge of riding his e-scooter rashly and endangering the personal safety of the victim.

> The court was shown closed-circuit television footage depicting the incident. The boy's mother was sitting outside the Gift Greetings shop at the mall while her son and husband were in the store.

> The corridor was crowded, with people streaming through at about 7pm that day. Neo was riding his e-scooter along the corridor when he knocked into the boy just outside the shop, as the child was walking towards his mother.

> The boy fell backwards and hit his head against the floor, sustaining a bruise that measured 3cm by 3cm.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Neo dismounted from his e-scooter and gave the boy's mother his name and contact number, before continuing to make his delivery.

> The boy's mother later lodged a police report.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Lai told the court that he would not be objecting to probation for Neo.

> He said Neo's speed was ""not that fast"" and that he was not ""blazing through the corridor"". He added that the reason ""we prosecuted this case was that it was a crowded corridor"".

> To ride an e-scooter in a crowded mall places others in danger, said the prosecutor.

> District Judge May Mesenas agreed, and asked Neo, who was unrepresented, if he had anything to say.

> Neo said: ""I will never ride in a mall again next time.""

> He told the judge that he ""just got a proper job"" in logistics. She called for a probation suitability report and adjourned the case to Jul 25.

> The maximum penalties for causing hurt by a rash act are a year's jail, a S$5,000 fine, or both.

So all my personal info and bank details were transferred smoothly. Too lazy to do everything again lol. Only that i had to pick up the new food bag from Grab office. 
Not sure how much DRoo or FP paid their riders, but i get paid $6 per delivery. Plus $2 extra if there is high demand peak hours.
Grabeat can be funny too. I was near Pasir Ris Downtown East and got order request at tampines mall to deliver food to Kaki Bukit. With motorycycle or e-scooter, it wont be a problem. But with bicycle, there might be some delay. 
And then when you reach the outlet, especially McD during dinner time, you need to wait more before the foods are prepared. So customer have to wait longer than expected. Feel srry for them most of the time.

It happened a few times that i got more than 4km to pick up foods with bicycle. I think Grab need to improve the rider app or they just dont have many motorcycle rider. This never happened with ubereats. 

I could do 10 or more deliveries with Ubereats per day but now with Grabeat I can do max 7 or 8 deliveries because the distance tired me to death ",9,2018-07-04,19:05:33

Nobody is bullying anybody, its all about business and profits.

How I know enough or not for the sensitive muslims. How do *you* know? You are not them, you don't get to tell them how they should have things. Just like they don't get to tell you or I to eat halal. That's religious freedom, right? How is that goondoo?

They asked for it, Deliveroo said ""OK sure"". Deliveroo doesn't take anything away from you. Deliveroo is making the bet that this will make them more money and open up the market more for muslims. If they die, they die. If they make money, they make money. You still have foodpanda and other services. That's market freedom, right? How is that goondoo?

There are valid criticisms to make. Like, how to ensure Deliveroo driver keep food properly? How to ensure bags are safely secured? Won't it be a bit wasteful to have one giant empty bag if there are no halal deliveries? To me all of these are reasonable things to talk about. 

But here in this thread everyone just complain muslims being treated like overly special snowflakes. If you don't eat halal food, it doesn't affect you. Complain for the sake of complain only. It has racist overtones.

"> #Deliveroo rider whose bicycle had no brakes admits to causing 73-year-old's death

> SINGAPORE - A Deliveroo delivery rider failed to obey a red light signal when he cycled across a pedestrian crossing and hit an elderly pedestrian, causing his death.

> Khairul Hairuman&apos;s view was blocked by a bus on the left lane of Lorong Ah Soo just before the pedestrian crossing, and traffic flow was heavy at the time.

> The 19-year-old, whose bicycle had no brakes and was not designed for use on roads or in public places, admitted to causing the death of Mr Tong Cheng Poh, 73, by doing a rash act at about 5.15pm on April 13 last year.

> Khairul was cycling along the two-lane road towards Upper Paya Lebar Road that evening when he noticed that the traffic light signal was red, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Zu Zhao in court on Tuesday (Jan 16).

> There were many cars on both lanes and an SBS Transit bus stopped on the left. Khairul decided to ride between the vehicles on both lanes.

> As he neared the signalised pedestrian crossing, he mistakenly thought that the traffic light signal had turned green for him, though his view was blocked by the bus on his left.

> He picked up speed to cycle across the pedestrian crossing.

> Mr Cheng was walking very slowly along the pedestrian crossing on a ""green man&apos;&apos; signal when he was struck by Khairul&apos;s bicycle. He died from a head injury the next day.

> The bicycle was inspected and found to have no front and rear brake levers or calipers. But it was fixed with ""coaster brakes&apos;&apos;, a special rear hub brake that operates by turning the pedals backwards.

> It could brake only on its own at very slow speeds, said DPP Lee.

> Khairul knew that the bicycle had never had rear brakes fixed. About a week before the accident, he had removed the faulty front brakes, which were not replaced.

> ""Without either front or rear brakes, the accused would normally use his right foot to step on the rear tyre of the said bicycle to slow down, and it would take at least four to five seconds to stop completely,&apos;&apos; the DPP said.

> DPP Lee is asking for four months&apos; jail to be imposed. He said Khairul ran the red light, knew that his bicycle had no brakes and continued to use it on a public road.

> Khairul, who had no lawyer, told Community Court Judge Eddy Tham that had the victim been in his 40s, he would have survived the accident.

> He said he called for assistance and helped carry the victim to the side of the road and waited for the ambulance.

> Judge Tham postponed sentencing to Feb 6 for the prosecution to make further submissions.

> The maximum penalty for causing death by a rash act is five years&apos; jail and a $5,000 fine.

"**Fixed-gear bicycle**

A fixed-gear bicycle (or fixed-wheel bicycle, commonly known in some places as a fixie) is a bicycle that has a drivetrain with no freewheel mechanism. The freewheel was developed early in the history of bicycle design but the fixed-gear bicycle remained the standard track racing design. More recently the ""fixie"" has become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists, offering the advantage of simplicity compared with the standard multi-geared bicycle.

Most bicycle hubs incorporate a freewheel to allow the pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum.

"**Vicarious liability**

Vicarious liability is a form of a strict, secondary liability that arises under the common law doctrine of agency, respondeat superior, the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate or, in a broader sense, the responsibility of any third party that had the ""right, ability or duty to control"" the activities of a violator. It can be distinguished from contributory liability, another form of secondary liability, which is rooted in the tort theory of enterprise liability because, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. The law has developed the view that some relationships by their nature require the person who engages others to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing of those others.

Now the cracks are showing. The choices keep dwindling (I live in an area with fantastic food nearby but most of them have disappeared, leaving only the chains); the interface has changed (no longer tells you whether a restaurant has a minimum order up front, it only tells you once you go to the restaurant and then put an order into your cart); the delivery charges have gone up (from $3 to $4+ now, making a stickier and more investor-friendly subscription model the ""better"" choice for consumers by making ad-hoc orders shittier).  

Meanwhile the riders sometimes take your food, or take their time (so the food comes cold). Clearly they aren't being paid enough to care.

Grab might survive on softbank money and once they are the *de facto* monopoly all of the good deals you see on their app will disappear.

But suddenly, after questioning them for a while longer, they suddenly claim that they tried to contact me and my order was picked up by another rider and thus not deliverable. 

So where does the two orders go? Do they throw it away? Two perfectly good about $70 orders? Just because one rider was somewhere in chai chee doing god knows what and another picked up the wrong order?

this is the correct answer. Uber car services has also burnt money by the hundreds of million in the name of claiming market share presumably hoping to be dominant when self driving cars come online and they would then drop a significant cost source in the form of driver ,4,2017-11-20,20:56:21

"I think both are $3 or $3.50. Honestbee has free delivery above a certain amount, Ubereats has surge pricing sometimes. I think Ubereats has a bigger range of eateries though there are some on Honestbee that I don't see on other apps (e.g. A1 Claypot Porridge at Compass One shows up for me on Honestbee but not the other apps).

The last few times I used Honestbee though, the app was a bit wonky - the status update is always stuck until the rider picks it up. So you won't be able to tell if they're preparing your food etc unless you contact the chat. And I've noticed that they put very long delivery times now (60-70 mins) or even just ""close"" the restaurant during peak hours. I suspect they don't have enough riders. ",3,2017-11-20,18:13:53

"I used to cycle for UberEats when that was still a thing. I think it works differently compared to the other services but hopefully I can give you an idea. The salary for UE was on a weekly payout, by order, abt $5-9 per order You can work anytime, but at the same time you aren't guaranteed an order. There are periods of high demand like lunch and dinner and they'll increase the rates to encourage you to work. They also gave me perks to work towards, like $abc bonus if I completed xyz  no of trips in a week.

Personally I feel it's not worth it, pay doesn't scale well with distance travelled, and unless you have ultra stamina, it's difficult to  keep it up and reach the milestones. I tried it bc I like cycling, but in the end it was too tiring and I was fed up with hobo-ing at nex waiting for jobs. Also UE favoured motorcyclists over cyclists so many of the perks that apply to MC riders may not apply to you.

"The current clear plastic food containers are already somewhat reusable, just wash them out and dry off. Then they can be used a number of times for food storage, packed meals etc before the become discoloured or break or just get plain icky.

Then there’s this new reusable container, how much energy does that consume to produce? What is the average lifespan of the container in deliveries? If the new containers themselves take the same energy and produce the same amount of pollution as 20+ of the current containers, but then only last 10-15 deliveries, is that not more harmful to the environment? 

Then there’s the return journey the containers must take that requires time and energy. The restaurant is unlikely to be so the customers daily route, so it’s going to need another scooter journey to collect it.

It doesn’t seem to be the answer to me, it just looks like someone’s trying to meet a quota regardless.

I’m not suggesting that we reuse our clear plastic containers, I’m suggesting that we look hard at our unsustainable polluting lifestyles and  ask what can society and ourselves do to make eating more sustainable in the long run. 

Personally I have a tiny kitchen and I use it as often as I can. Use glass and metal containers to take meals to eat at work. Eat in at hawkers or restaurants and if getting take out, buy from a place nearby and on the way home so it’s walkable.",28,2020-11-11,19:19:51

"> # Reusable containers for your next food delivery?

> SINGAPORE: As more people opt for meals delivered to their doorstep amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the three largest food delivery players in Singapore have made reusable containers an option in the hope of reducing the use of disposable packaging.

> These containers are available for orders made with participating food and beverage (F&B) businesses, which number more than 100 at the moment across Foodpanda, Deliveroo and GrabFood.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The new option is part of ongoing plans to cut down on single-use packaging in food deliveries, said these platforms, although the pandemic and rise in delivery orders have spurred the need for more sustainable alternatives.

> A local study published in June showed that the “circuit breaker”, rolled out in early-April to curb the spread of COVID-19, led to an increase in disposable containers and cutlery usage.

> 

> An extra 1,334 tonnes of plastic waste was generated from takeaway and delivery meals during the two-month period which banned dine-ins at eating places and shuttered schools and most workplaces, the study found.

> The initiative comes at a time when the spotlight is being shone on the impact of single-use plastics on the environment and the role they play in climate change.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Last year, a report by the Centre for International Environmental Law said that the global production and incineration of plastic would add add more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

> The earliest to roll out the new option was Foodpanda which began partnering two reusable container lending services – BarePack and Muuse – in April and July, respectively. It now has 48 F&B businesses on board.

> “We are very committed to reducing waste, especially that of single-use plastics,” said its marketing and sustainability director Laura Kantor.

> Advertisement

> “We explored partnerships with BarePack and Muuse with this in mind, but the pandemic definitely pushed us to increase awareness and adoption of this initiative.”

> 

> GrabFood teamed up with Muuse about a month ago and is currently in a pilot phase with 10 restaurants.

> Over at Deliveroo, which is partnering BarePack, customers have been able to order food in reusable cups and boxes from more than 50 restaurants since Oct 7.

> “With the ongoing initiative, Deliveroo hopes to combat rising disposable packaging waste in the city-state as a result of movement restrictions, especially during the circuit breaker period,” a spokesperson said.

> 

> HOW IT WORKS

> 

> Under the partnerships, both BarePack and Muuse will provide the reusable containers used for deliveries.

> 

> Customers will have to return these containers to either the restaurants they ordered from or any participating merchant. BarePack also offers home collection services.

> 

> Foodpanda said since the launch, delivery and self pick-up orders using these reusable packaging have “more than tripled’ over the last six months.

> Grab and Deliveroo, whose initiatives have just started, did not provide take-up rates.

> 

> Muuse’s chief executive Brian Reilly said its collaborations with the food delivery platforms have been “extremely helpful” in pushing for more to embrace a zero-waste lifestyle.

> “As takeaway and delivery orders shot up since the circuit breaker period kicked in, there has been a significant increase in the use of single-use packaging. However, we believe people were hungry for a change,” he added, noting how its user base tripled from July to September on the back of these new partnerships.

> 

> Barepack’s co-founder and chief executive Roxane Uzureau echoed that: “The delivery additions have certainly made takeaway in reusables much more convenient than simply Bring Your Own.”

> The sharing service started at the end of 2019 by lending its reusable cups and food boxes to restaurants for takeaways. It gradually expanded its network of F&B businesses and now saves about 100 disposable packaging a week, according to Ms Uzureau.

> 

> Barepack’s members get to order food on the delivery platforms for free, while non-members have to pay a deposit of S$6 which will be refunded when they return the reusable containers. There is no time limit for users to return the containers, although each user is only allowed to borrow up to five.

> On the other hand, Muuse charges S$25 to those who do not return their containers after 14 days.

> Muuse said its collaborations with the food delivery platforms have been “extremely helpful” in pushing for more to embrace a zero-waste lifestyle. (Photo: Muuse)

> So far, all reusable containers have been returned promptly, representatives of both sharing services told CNA.

> 

> Foodpanda said the return process is “fuss-free” as customers will be given instructions, while Deliveroo noted that it has not received any reports of customers facing difficulties in returning the containers.

> Once collected, participating F&B businesses will clean the containers before reusing them for new deliveries.

> Asked about hygiene concerns amid the pandemic, Muuse said the cleaning process is done “in line with strict Government regulations governing the use of dine-in tableware and containers”. It added that it conducts regular spot checks and follows updates from the Singapore Food Agency closely.

> 

> Similarly for BarePack, all containers are “cleaned to the same standards” as that of dine-ins. It also worked with Deliveroo to implement “stringent” safety protocols, such as ensuring that reusable containers are “collected away from restaurant serving areas and batch processed with used crockery”.

> 

> WHAT F&B BUSINESSES SAY

> 

> Shake Farm began making deliveries with reusable containers from BarePack and Muuse since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

> 

> “Due to the huge increase of delivery volume and the large amount of takeaway packaging being used every day, it made a lot of sense to use reusable containers,” said its founder Danny Chambers.

> But this only makes up about 5 per cent of its orders – a “considerably low” figure, according to Mr Chambers. “We hope that this will increase considerably in the future as it’s a lot better for the environment,"" he said.

> 

> SaladStop!, Heybo and Wooshi, which offers the reusable options via Deliveroo, said they registered an average of 5 such orders a day since the initiative began in early-October.

> 

> BarePack’s reusable containers have been made available for takeaways at these stores since February, said Ms Katherine Braha, co-founder and director at Fresh Creation Holdings which manages the three F&B brands.

> The company has been an advocate of the reusable culture in Singapore, encouraging Bring Your Own practices and launching its own reusable merchandise. And with COVID-19 spurring the number of online orders, it saw the partnership between BarePack and Deliveroo as “a great solution to make (its) deliveries more eco-friendly”.

> 

> Asked if the cleaning of the reusable containers could be extra work for its employees, Ms Braha said: “As the BarePack containers are a new set of materials for cleaning, this does add to the workload for our staff.

> 

> “However, we have had BarePack available in our stores since early this year, so staff were already familiar with the collecting and washing procedures.”

> 

> She added: “We anticipate that as more merchants begin to participate in the barePack programme, this responsibility will become better shared.”

> Moving forward, the delivery and container sharing companies are looking to expand the number of participating F&B businesses and increase user rates.

> Muuse said it is working on a rewards programme for its users, alongside plans to make the “return process as easy as possible” and sign up more F&B outlets, according to Mr Reilly.

> The spokesperson for Deliveroo said the company is committed to helping its F&B partners become more sustainable and “will be actively seeking to expand this initiative to more restaurants in coming weeks”.

>

What if I order food every day? Doesn’t make sense to “collect” this container every order right?,1,2020-11-11,16:33:25
"The company I work for was pitched to by one of the companies. What they said was that while customers should at least rinse the containers before returning, the onus is still on the restaurant to clean the containers properly before deploying them again.

Ultimately, we decided against it because crew complained it was a hassle managing two sets of takeaway packaging, and they only had one size, which couldn't fit our burgers.",1,2020-11-12,12:46:10
"The idea is for you to collect, perhaps help wash them, and then return them so they can be reused for future orders. 

The penalties do seem pretty punitive, though I suppose they have to be to prevent people from simply holding on to them or just throwing them away.",2,2020-11-11,17:22:18
"Yeah, the idea is admirable but the ground reality makes it quite a challenge to implement. The last part is odd, that there’s only a fixed size available for orders..",1,2020-11-12,13:05:34
"If they want to do this, I actually like Korea eateries’ way. Many of them send deliveries in actual container or bowl, string-wrapped, the delivery guy will return to customers to collect few hours after. Of course, this will not work here that emphasizes so much on cost and efficiency, productivity.",9,2020-11-11,17:31:13
"Under the programme, you can return your container to any participating shop. Having one size is easy. It means all the shops that opt in, can immediately wash and reuse any container that is returned to them. Avoids a situation where you have a stockpile of containers that you can't use.",2,2020-11-12,13:28:51
"Maybe if the restaurant employs its own delivery crew, but this are freelance delivery services we are talking about. I don’t think grab is going to foot the cost of sending another rider to your house to collect the containers a few hours later.",8,2020-11-11,17:39:31
"To be honest, it's easy to build a milk run logic to the grab server and pick up multiple per return trip.

The real problem is what random stuff people will do with the policy and what kind of mess will be hanging at the doors. Similar to our mobike obike situation. Can't have good things etc.",2,2020-11-11,20:44:32
"I am currently a part-time food courier with both UberEats and Honestbee. Here's what I can share about each:

&nbsp;

UberEats:

- You work anytime you want, anywhere. All you have to do to start working is go online on your Uber Driver application.

- If you work on weekday afternoons, I would recommend city area cos everywhere else has pretty much little to no demand

- Weekday nights and weekends are the best time to work UberEats in just about any location.

- Best times to work are 11 AM to 3 PM, 5:45 PM to 9 PM as multipliers tend to be the highest around these times, but it may vary by the day and location.

- I personally average around $11 per hour with added incentives working at Serangoon on weekday and weekend nights, as well as the city area on weekday afternoons but I rarely do the city area now as it is almost an hour away from where I live.

- Payment is calculated from Monday to Sundays, and money is transferred to your account weekly on Thursdays.

Unfortunatedly, I heard UberEats has stopped letting in cyclists as they have an over-supply of them now, so they are only open to motorcylists.

&nbsp;

Honestbee:

- This is slightly better than UberEats in the sense that they have a base $6 pay and $8 per delivery. 

- However, you will have use an application to reserve your work time slots beforehand, unlike UberEats where you can just start working by going online in the applications anytime, anywhere.

- Unfortunatedly, even though the advertised pay is up to $22 per hour assuming base pay plus two deliveries per hour, rarely anyone hits that amount. 

- In fact, most people do not go past a single digit per hour due to the fact that there is a lack of demand and thus deliveries throughout the entire island, irregardless of area.

- However, because there is a base pay, even if there are no orders, you still get to take home something. Get no orders with UberEats and you will be eating grass.

- Just like UberEats, payment is calculated from Monday to Sundays, and money is transferred to your account weekly on Thursdays.

&nbsp;

What I personally do for a typical delivery day:

- I would reserve slots for HonestBee in the afternoon near where I live in Serangoon, where I am paid a hourly base pay and given maybe one or two deliveries. 

- This way, I make around the same amount I would make doing UberEats in the city area in the afternoon, but I do fewer deliveries and spend less time getting cooked in the afternoon sun. And I do not have to spend time travelling to the city area.

- In the evening, I do UberEats instead and take advantage of the dinnertime demand near Nex. If possible, I'll take a slot with Honestbee just before 7 PM since demand for UberEats does not start till around that time.

- Once the UberEats mutipliers end in the evening, I head home. Typical hours for me is 11 AM to 3 PM for Honestbee, 6 PM to 10 PM for UberEats. 

For the whole day, I average between $50 to $80. Per week for tentatively three full days and one weekend night I take home around $200 in total.

&nbsp;

Of course, more importantly is to not try to maximise your per hour earnings by trying to complete your deliveries too fast. You will easily get tired and lose momentum for the whole day, and increase your chances of getting into an accident which will put you out of work for a long time. 

Pace yourself, what you earn in the long term is more important than what you earn in that one hour.",74,2017-09-07,19:29:09
"Looks like not many couriers here. Perhaps you could order some food from each company, chat with the couriers for a few minutes, you could even walk with him down to his bike. Give him a nice tip if he's nice and friendly!",11,2017-09-07,18:28:41
"Somebody else asked this before. Gonna copy and paste my comment here:

Worked Ubereats for 1.5 months. Living in Bedok but my friend and I chose Pasir Ris, better cause will only have to do deliveries in Pasir Ris.

(Pasir ris is just pasir ris in the Ubereats app, but bedok, kembangan, tampines, expo and simei is counted as 1 part)

Tried Bedok area on the first day and it was hell. Collect food from bedok mall, deliver to kembangan. Then collect food for another delivery at bedok mall again, deliver to Tampines. No point so Pasir Ris all the way for the rest of the 1.5 months.

Ubereats is count by total earnings for the trip x surge rate for that hour, so typically earn $10-16 per trip on sat/sun peak hour, $4-10 per trip on weekdays.

On a good day 3 orders an hour. There were a few times when my app was on for 8 hours, only got 1 order. Try to have the mindset whereby you work Ubereats more to exercise and earn extra cash, rather than to have a stable income.

Try not to work during non lunch/dinner timings. Very rarely get orders.

Make sure you get a phone mount, easier to accept orders and look at the map so you won't lose your way. DO BRING portable charger as well, cause the app is gonna be active the entire day to receive orders, which drains alot of battery.

The best perk about this job is that there will not be anyone bossing you around, it is OTOT so work anytime, rest anytime. 

TL;DR: Extremely unstable income, your earnings depends on if you get deliveries or not. Great for exercising and earning extra cash.",6,2017-09-07,20:33:48

"Currently doing peak shifts for Deliveroo as a weekend job, they only have limited areas that will let you work on a bicycle. Like Honestbee, you need to book a shift yourself.  
  
Also, pick your delivery areas wisely, as they can make or break your pay and/or fitness. I'm doing the Bukit Timah area and I could only do like 1 delivery/hour bcoz my legs cmi. Really, try cycling up 6th Ave towards Holland V. Twice. ",2,2017-09-08,01:25:48
"I see alot of people using e-scooters to do deliveries. From my understanding, an average e-scooter can go about 30km max? Enough juice to do many deliveries meh? ",2,2017-09-08,08:54:23

"I can confirm Food Panda will definitely have more orders since they are far more popular. I cannot comment on the pay though as I do not know how their pay system works. But the great thing about such companies is you can work for as many of them as you want since you are technically independent of them.

So yea, just join both and you can choose whom to work for when you feel like it.",4,2017-09-07,20:55:23

"Totally not related to the topic but if you’re looking for a decent paying job you can go try out Fairprice, as a cashier. For festive period such as November to Feb they pay $10/hr (I went there to work when I was waiting for my results three years back). The only disadvantage is that you’ve gotta work 6 days a week but the shift is just 5 hours per day so it was a pretty solid income job.",13,2017-10-15,05:32:45
"I signed on with foodpanda but it's nearly impossible to get a shift, especially with areas where there's already alot of riders. you may have better luck with ubereats or deliveroo.",9,2017-10-15,00:34:29
"It's been 3 month since I've worked with ubereats and I ride an electric scooter. The pay per hour depends on how fast you can deliver in that hour. Lets say on the weekdays 1 delivery I can earn about $5.74 and within that hour i can earn another $5.55 which total up to $10+ per hour. The problem i faced is that there are not many orders on the weekdays hence you might sit around doing nothing for the next hour . Even on the weekends , sometimes I sit around Nexx doing nothing for like 30 mins waiting for orders to come in. And there's incentive like when you finish 10 orders you can get earn extra money. Overall it's a fun job and the pay is every week so you won't go broke and you'll have the money to spend.",6,2017-10-15,01:05:06

"deliveroo: 

entry - fairly straightforward: onboarding session online, after which you proceed to make appointment to fill out forms and get your gear. can be done in one single day. (note: $50 deposit for gear, returnable). You can choose your location then, but only one location is allowed and changing is very hard.

Operates on staff-o-matic app, there's an app provided so you can take up jobs and navigate to location etc. Bicycle/e-scooter VS motorcycle has different pay. Sign up for a slot on staff-o-matic, get to the place, turn on the app, and you're on.

Can't remember motorcycle pay, but bicycle is a base rate of $5 per hit with varying incentives based on various time periods and locations (greatest is weekend, evening, CBD). Motorcycle pay is more, but not that much more.

There's a tip box but people don't usually tip for a bicycle delivery since it takes quite long.

After filling forms and getting gear, you're practically free to do what you like when you like. I haven't done anything for the past 2 months since there's exams, and so far nothing's exploded.

Deliveroo: easy to sign up, no immense obligations. Prepare to earn at most 2 hits an hour if you're a bicycle guy. 

That's deliveroo as a bicycle rider in SG Sengkang/Punggol. I'm not sure about the rest. Hope this helps. You're better off doing part-times tbh unless you want to exercise at the same time, to which my thighs say this is great and my knee joints disagree.

I have no issues with Deliveroo thus far and I am surprised that this company (3rd in ranking after Grab and Panda) are not given a second look by most. Problem is... maybe... deliveroo does not have islandwide delivery.,8,2020-08-24,22:34:15
"Speaking as a weekend rider for then - their service/support is shit tier. I dread contacting them so much i personally issue refunds to customers direct than make them request for one.

I dont understand why they cant hire a local team for support. Alot of the queries from riders ahd customers are pretty bog standard and just require some contextual/local knowledge a bot might not pick up.

They need a full restructure of the dispatch and service team. In addition they need to tone correct their marketing towards riders with regards to incentives.",8,2020-08-25,01:19:24
"Deliveroo > Grab > Foodpanda.

I had a problem last month with one of my vouchers — every time I email in (since live chat only works if there's an order placed), I get someone else, and I would have to explain my issue again. One CSO even gave me a voucher code that expired _two weeks before_ my email.

I believe their Facebook page is manned by more competent people (but still facepalm-level). You can try posting a comment to one of their posts, and hopefully they'll ask for your ticket number and take a look at it.

My issue hasn't been resolved, but I pretty much gave up. Some of Foodpanda's promos are good, but their service recovery is a _huge_ waste of time if things go wrong.

> All of the refunds is due to them double charging me which btw the first few agents vehemently denied i was double charged until i showed my bank statements. Only then did the agreed but instead of doing a lump sum refund they have been slowly processing each individual refund and everytime i bring this up their CS agents will be like “don’t worry you’ll get your money back ❤️” siao.

File a dispute with your bank. Double-charging is a valid reason within Visa/Mastercard to file a dispute. [I did so with TPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i4psi2/psa_if_you_have_a_tpg_line_you_might_want_to/).",7,2020-08-24,21:57:51

1. Ordered pizza in with colleagues, and despite the restaurant saying that our order was ready, the rider never turned up. Since it was near enough, my boss drove out and collected it instead. Rider never ever showed up.
2. A couple of years, later, thought they might have improved and gave them a second chance. Ordered in pizza (again!), got a call from the restaurant directly to ask me if I wanted to change an item which was OOS, which I did. Food came, I thanked the rider and thought wow, they are ok this time round, only to discover a missing item (not the aforementioned earlier). Called back the outlet and they never picked up, and ended up having to haggle with CS. Got a $5 voucher but never used it as I gave up on Foodpanda.

Could just be probability but I've never ran into such issues with their competitors.",2,2020-08-25,10:14:15

Contacted the useless CS only for them to tell me to wait patiently for half an hour more and to check outside my door (which I checked) and they only agreed to a refund after I started scolding them.

They offered to give me a 5% discount code for my trouble, which is obviously ridiculous. We’ve already cooked instant noodles by then, and the food is obviously in questionable condition if it was a delay by the driver.

The customer service just told me to keep checking outside my door when I said multiple times I don’t see it there and I even took a pic of my neighbour’s door and asked if that is where he hung the food.

"I once ordered minced meat noodles and requested for sambal chilli.  
This is one of those dishes that I don't enjoy without the chilli.  
To me, eating minced meat noodles with no chilli is like eating steak well done without any salt, pepper or sauces.

Anyways, first order: no chilli.

Called up foodpanda CS and offered to make a second order immediately just so that they can bring the second order with enough chilli for both orders.

foodpanda CS assured me that he will make sure the next order went well but terminates the chat as I was making the order.

Food came with no chilli again. I rejected the order.

foodpanda CS refuses to refund either of my orders.

Only after unleashing my inner Ken did I get $10 vouchers.

I found out later that the foodpanda rider gave the second order to the security guard.

How did Deliveroo handle this similar situation?

The Deliveroo CS told me where I could find the restaurant's contact number and advised me to contact the restaurant if I have any dietary requirements.

No issues with my orders ever since.

Mee siam mai hum?

No problem, just call the restaurant, tell the restaurant my order number and my request.

EDIT:  
Why the downvote? 

It's not like I asked foodpanda to just deliver the chilli in itself.   
I offered and actually ordered the 2nd set just so that they can rectify the mistake.  
AND the foodpanda CS did assure me that the will get the next order right and so I expect him to keep his word, which he didn't.",8,2020-08-24,22:13:08

Dear,

Thank you for choosing foodpanda.

foodpanda doesn't settle for anything short of perfection when it comes to delivering satisfaction to customers like you, so such a mistake is not something we can look past. I am sorry to hear that your cooking instructions for order gxxo-2xx1 with Cold Stone Creamery (The Gardens Mall) was not followed.

This is indeed not the type of experience we strive for. There can be unusual situations, which are contrary to the expectations. We hope that your next experience with us would be a good one.

We don't like average. We will get better. Promise!

For further inquiries, please feel free to reach out to us via Help Center. You can count on us 24/7.

We love our customers and would like to see you back soon. 🐼❤️

Thank you and have a great time ahead!",1,2020-09-01,23:49:22

"I called seller for the refund because the item ordered was not there... and then after she approved i called the CS. the CS said she will offset the 2 dollar amount as discussed with the seller and then after saying she already applied the 2 dollars refund she then said since I never met the 18 dollar amount there will be a 4 dollars and 50 cents charge for the delivery... she said that AFTER she applied the refund. there was no way for me to do a re order or anything to cover that and its not even my fault that seller doesnt have the item. 

I tried to fight for that because its pointless to do the 2 dollars refund if they are going to charge me 4.5... she refused so hard and I feel like im just wasting my time so I just hang up... I dont think its worth another 30 minutes just to even fight for that amount... 

man its so frustrating after remembering that experience... sorry if it was unclear.",1,2020-08-25,19:55:46
"Ken. Not Karen. 

But let me get this straight.

foopanda provide a special request but customer cannot use it?

Minced meat noodles usually have the option of sambal chilli and vinegar but now the customer cannot ask for it?  
Btw, they updated the menu to have those options now so I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one requesting for it. 

foodpanda did not keep their word and I can't oppose that?  
If I cannot ask for the sambal chilli, foodpanda should just say it upright instead of agreeing for me to make the second order and promising that it will be righted.

foodpanda rider gave the rejected food away instead of reporting it as a rejected order and that's ok?",6,2020-08-25,00:32:13

"Alright, how do I to talk to the rider directly?

All I could do was use the rider chat, but the rider showed me that he did not get any message at all.   
Another rider who delivers to my area later told me their app sucks ass and that the message generally only appears when they reach the customer.

Yeah, the vendor is the problem, but so is the foodpanda CS. 

Can, say can. Cannot, say cannot. 

Don't promise something then don't deliver.  
And the foodpanda CS definitely has the ability to contact the rider and tell him to double check on the order before leaving the vendor.

I would've stopped at the 1st order if the foodpanda CS is just upfront about it.",0,2020-08-25,15:34:06
"A rider who says he can't see the message, is either lying or the facing some app problems.

When you order something thru the FP app, you can press the chat to message the rider. The rider HAS to reply a customer message before he can proceed with anything (pressing pick up/seeing address/pressing delivered)

In doing so, you will also be able to see the Rider's name from your notification bar.

IF rider decides to play punk, you have your order number and riders name.

Customers aren't the only one facing customer support issues. Us riders have our fair share of problems from Cx, vendor and support.",2,2020-08-25,15:41:03
"Am a foodpanda rider, can also confirm that the app sucks ass. Sometimes when I get a message notification from the customer, and once I open it, it will disconnect itself and I can't open the chat window anymore. The only clue is the brief heads up notification that I saw before tapping it, but I won't know the full message. Feedback countless times but nothing changed. 

So don't rely too much on the rider chat. If you want a foolproof way to get your message across to the rider, before you place your order, add it in the ""notes to rider"" in your address section. It will definitely show up on our app. But remember to clear it for the future orders. 

Also, don't bother with the CS, they are all outsourced to Pakistan now, probably. And they always like to end the chat before addressing concerns.",2,2020-08-25,15:52:16
"Yea they have to reply. But sometimes the app really has problems. I'm sure you would have encountered the ""access token is invalid"" bug you try to open the chat window. Usually it is solved by the next order, but just as a benefit of doubt.",1,2020-08-25,15:57:52
"Idk if me ordering via website contributes to the issue.

But the rider did show me his inbox got no message from me.

Btw, can riders actually give rejected deliveries away?   
I always thought that's not allowed.

On the side note, I am glad to say I have not been using Grabfood for like years since I noticed in general they charge more for the food and delivery charges on their website as compared to food panda and deliveroo.

I think their logarithm is too smart.

It displays the restaurant that 1) can allow them to earn the highest commission fee first, then subsequently I believe they sort it by 2) popularity

So I assume the logarithm groups high potential restaurants (those that many will order and can allow for stack orders) so one driver can come and do the stacked orders at one go.

Whereas maybe OP restaurant is less popular and therefore is not even displayed. Probably they want to channel all possible riders to do stacked orders as compared to using one rider for one order which isn't efficient.",1,2020-06-06,03:20:44

Different countries have different Regional or Country Director with different work cultures.

The algorithm may also hide lower-priced businesses based on prevailing parameters, such as customers and delivery riders availability, to maximize earning potential for the condition.

Don't believe me? If you have any money in stocks at all, do you know what the companies that you partially own do, and where they draw the line in terms of what is price gouging? If you can't answer that question, you may begin to understand the disjoint the current financial system has, and you may begin to appreciate that you are actually part of the problem.

The waiter always tell the riders to wait when the riders tried to rush them. It can be annoying to many riders as it’s their main source of income and waiting means they are wasting their time and not earning any money. 

As a customer, I can also understand that it can be annoying to wait such a long time with an empty stomach. Especially when the estimated time seems to be extending infinitely.

"I did foodpanda delivery as a cyclist for a day. I was posted to the East office.

You take orders using your phone so you'd need a phone with good battery. You'll want to take plenty of water and be prepared to snack alot because you're gonna burn out quick. 

Orders were damn shag. You have to report to the office at the start of your shift, to sign in and collect your bag. Then off you go. Order are everywhere. I cycled from Paya Lebar > Aljunied > Paya > Aljunied > Paya > Tai Seng > Paya > Eunos > Kembangan > Bedok Reservoir > Paya. I actually took the MRT home from Bedok because I was so tired and couldn't be arsed to cycle to Paya then back home. 

Think now it's a little better. You can keep the bag so you don't need to report back. 

Pay wise it's better than retail and F&B jobs. Just hope your bike doesn't fuck up or shit like that so you don't need to spend more. Think it was like base $6 + $2 every order your complete (docket). I averaged 2.5 dockets every hour so $11/h for me. 

Go ahead if you want to exercise a ton. It's gonna feel super tiring and you have to wear their long sleeve shirt and long pants + covered shoes. It's good for people who don't want to work with others because you'll be alone.  Also, be safe, please be safe. ",16,2017-08-05,10:43:39

"Worked Ubereats for 1.5 months. Living in Bedok but my friend and I chose Pasir Ris, better cause will only have to do deliveries in Pasir Ris.

(Pasir ris is just pasir ris in the Ubereats app, but bedok, kembangan, tampines, expo and simei is counted as 1 part)

Tried Bedok area on the first day and it was hell. Collect food from bedok mall, deliver to kembangan. Then collect food for another delivery at bedok mall again, deliver to Tampines. No point so Pasir Ris all the way for the rest of the 1.5 months.

Ubereats is count by total earnings for the trip x surge rate for that hour, so typically earn $10-16 per trip on sat/sun peak hour, $4-10 per trip on weekdays.

On a good day 3 orders an hour. There were a few times when my app was on for 8 hours, only got 1 order. Try to have the mindset whereby you work Ubereats more to exercise and earn extra cash, rather than to have a stable income.

Try not to work during non lunch/dinner timings. Very rarely get orders.

Make sure you get a phone mount, easier to accept orders and look at the map so you won't lose your way. DO BRING portable charger as well, cause the app is gonna be active the entire day to receive orders, which drains alot of battery.

The best perk about this job is that there will not be anyone bossing you around, it is OTOT so work anytime, rest anytime.

But I can somewhat see Grab perspective. Maximise profits while they are making losses elsewhere. As I understand, their cashcow is more towards food delivery compared to ridehailing. And having such a surplus of riders, definitely does not help the situation. The easy barrier of entry makes the job and deliveries very replaceable, compared to FoodPanda and others.

And to be fair, we part-time delivery riders were never employees of FoodPanda/Grab/Deliveroo. We sign to proxy companies and work as contractors.

"Grab is symptomatic of those startups that have overextended themselves. Just open the app: Food, Mart, Delivery, Insurance, Gift Cards, Subscription, Tickets, Videos, Hotels, and, yes, transport. Cashless payment and a whole grassroots banking system that wants to replace fiat. Social media features and friends messaging. A live blog. Marketing offers from third parties that buy advertising space on the app. It’s a crowded, illegible mess, that exceeds the use case of 99% of its customers.

Its historical core mission (taken over from Uber) is matching the supply and demand for private transport on the island. There’s a legitimate case for the platform being agnostic of *what* is being transported -i.e. it may cater equally to food bags, parcels, or passengers- but it should just focus on serving that purpose *exceptionally* well. That means smart dynamic pricing algorithms, a responsive UI, precise geolocation and routing, an app that learns the travel habits of its customers really well, an awesome matching system, etc.

Instead, it has fallen into the habitual trap of an egomaniac and grandiose vision for a “lifestyle app” that has to be and do everything for everyone. As a result, it does each thing poorly, hurting customer service for both users and delivery partners.

They need a hard reset, or a lot more competition.",5,2020-04-06,10:09:25

"Biting the bullet to go against the general sentiment of this thread... 

But like another poster mentioned, I believe we've got to understand the bigger picture of how Grab is doing. 

For a long time now, they've been rolling out their food delivery subscription service (it used to be $8 for a $5 & $10 voucher + free 30 deliveries with no minimum cost; think it's now $10 for the same amount for vouchers, but 50 deliveries and $10 min cost - pardon me if I'm mistaken, gave up that habit of grabfooding a while back).

I used to be some of those dudes who would order a $6 meal (I knew a friend who would order a $3.50 bubble teas) and get free delivery. Since Grab pays roughly $6 or more to its riders, and still has to pay the hawker/restaurant, you can imagine the loss they must have incurred during this period of time. 

I believe the main reason behind this move was to take away market share from the other food delivery services like FoodPanda and Deliveroo, by undercutting their profits (most likely taking a loss like what happened with Uber).

So #1 we learnt that Grab's food delivery arm in the Singapore context has probably been incurring losses. 

And #2 is even if food deliveries see a spike, we must be reminded that Grab as a whole is doing poorly in this period of time. 

I've got a friend who's a driver there and boy, there are legit no passengers at all. And that means less profits for Grab too, in the area in which they rely on most.

In response to this, they've allowed drivers to too deliver food, which in turn increases the supply of people delivering food, and as you've mentioned... Supply & demand. 

So yeah, I believe these wage reducing measures were already bound to happen, and the current covid crisis might have simply expedited the process. 

PS. not a grab staff. Actually do not like Grab (felt their price cutting measures were too mean for my lack of business acumen mind) as I used to ride for food panda but I thought an objective opinion should be shared. 

On a more important note - stay safe and sane, everyone!",7,2020-04-06,09:33:03

"i really think it’s high time Singapore does something to revamp the entire food delivery system. we are so far behind compared to China (I’m not being biased or bootlicking, it comes from experience because I am studying in Shanghai). in China, there are 2 apps available: eleme 饿了么 and meituan 美团, and taking out food using these apps is considered the norm. delivery is cheap and fast and there is a wide variety of food available, with frequent discounts and membership offers. the differences between how SG and China operate the system are probably due to the fact that our deliverymen are not as mobile compared to Chinese ones, Chinese riders usually use large e-scooters we call 电瓶车 which is like an electronic motorbike but far more convenient and speedy. given that our traffic conditions don’t allow for proper bike lanes and such e-scooters are quite dangerous, the speed of our deliverymen gets affected. also we just don’t have so many riders compared to China. 

and while supermarket delivery is the norm in China, the apps also offer medicine/flowers/immediate parcel delivery services. i think there’s so much more to be learnt and revamped on the sg side, it shocks me to see that all the problems still exist till now even though Grab, Deliveroo and foodpanda have been here for some time alr. i get that the situation in both countries definitely differ, but i still gape at the exorbitant price that doesn’t translate to riders’ wages and smooth wide coverage of services.",13,2020-04-06,08:09:56

"Tried grabfood as a mirco time job between uni, its OTOT nature was pretty good for me, started in July, felt like during that time it was pretty fair, but as time goes on I've noticed incentives were completely dropped or halved.

Their driver support is 50/50, sometime you luck out get the support/compensation you need,  sometimes they tell you tough luck. 

Their payout, I guess on weekends are decent, above the standard $10/H ranging about $15 onwards but it has been reduced every few months I noticed, another draw back is your work hours is limited to when people are looking for food (lunch/dinner). 

I agree it's not the nicest job to have, but I'm of the opinion it shouldn't be your full time job, just something to earn some change while looking for a job or while schooling. However, met drivers that relys on grab/panda, felt they always get screwed the most.",3,2020-04-06,09:47:41

Growing revenue without positive unit economics is still acceptable is a good economy (banks are willing to lend and money can be raised by showing growth). Since future funding might be uncertain now, Grab would need to be more careful about burning its current funds. The adjustments are just Grab trying to make the unit economics less negative, reducing the burn rate. 

It doesn't look like it, but if they are running on negative unit economics, then they are indeed being responsible to the riders by doing this, rather than risk going out of business because they couldn't raise the money to continue.",3,2020-04-06,10:13:09

"Hi everyone, thanks for all the responses! Very heartened to see the care for our rider community. I'll address some of the more popular queries here:

- Who treats their partners better?

I have accounts with Grabfood and Deliveroo, and my close friend works for Foodpanda, so here's what I know:

Foodpanda - Fixed rate for deliveries, and the rate is quite fair (not the highest though) considering that your rider doesn't know your address until they've picked up your food (similar to Uber back in those days) - can be a good thing, can be a bad thing. But foodpanda dispatch is atrocious - if you thought their customer-facing support channels were bad, wait till you see their rider support. My friend had a job cancelled a week ago by accident after calling rider support to ask for cash reimbursement (customer made a cash order but noshow). Rider support still hasn't reimbursed him the trip fare or the cash portion of the food. Their tiering system also pits riders against each other - highest tier riders get paid more and can book slots early.

Deliveroo - By far the best company, if only they had better demand. Trips are more fairly compensated (they add our journey to the restaurant as part of the fare, Grab doesn't pay for distance to restaurant). Rider support is generally more friendly and knows what's going on. Policies are more reasonable. But their demand is trash - where I live, I can turn on Deliveroo for an entire day and get crickets.

Grab - Their flexibility is a huge bonus compared to the other 2. Things used to be good, getting worse by the day. One more incident comes to mind - they tried to get unsuspecting riders to ""upgrade"" their cash wallet, and when those riders cashed out, their earnings went into their Grabpay account (the one on the consumer app), not their bank account. Just like that, hard-earned money stuck with Grab. Absolutely scummy move in my opinion

- On Grab's balance sheet issues.

No doubt Grab is still making losses, but that isn't really my point. For a company that keeps putting out PR on helping partners and the community and all, I'm surprised they never thought about the optics of cutting rider pay during this time. If this was done any other time (pre-Covid), I don't think it would be such a problem. But in a time when Grab is actively trying to champion riders and drivers as ""essential to our community"" their act of lowering pay sure runs against that messaging.

It's telling to know that I'm not the only rider/driver/employee under Grab who feels this way. Hopefully they'll do something about it eventually.

Keep the comments coming, and stay safe y'all!

EDIT: If you're comfortable going out to dabao, do consider paying your neighborhood hawkers a visit! Buying directly from them means they earn more (cos no need to pay delivery commissions). Help keep them open during these tough times!",2,2020-04-06,11:07:52

"Look at my past post you'll see me ranting on Grab before. The company is a shadow of itself after beating off Uber and establishing itself here in Singapore. 

The company has to make money but they are squeezing the wrong side of the balance. The drivers and food deliver people who are the backbone of the services are being strangled and soon the camel back will break. Failure to see this is mind boggling. 

It's quite sad to see a fall from grace like this and all I could do when using the app is tip the drivers and delivery person. Unfortunately it isn't enough",2,2020-04-06,13:22:39

"Being a Grab driver, I’ve understood so well how they work. Their PR is always to benefit the community. Their tactic is always to throw money to lowball their competitors away. When given the chance to monopolise, the first group of ppl to cut is their drivers. In this case riders. Once upon a time, drivers pay 20% commissions to drivers. But suddenly, if u pick and choose, drivers need to pay 30%. Do again, pay 40%. It was the biggest outcry done by drivers. Cos it goes against the concept of us being their partners. We do the job, we pay 20%. That should be it. This is veering towards modern slavery. 

After that feeble attempt and also me being banned on their platform, they reversed on that change. And can you believe it, I was banned for being vocal about it. So for riders, it’s simple, stop supporting grab. Those ordering food, stop ordering from grab. 

Now, here’s the next problem. Ppl need money. Some don’t care about all these principles. Though some riders will stop using grab, many others will still do it. And that’s why grab will still keep on growing bigger and bigger. Cut the pay, and still ppl do. Kpk, still got ppl do. They learn from their experiences in dealing with Singapore drivers. That’s why they make subtle changes. This won’t be the end. It will keep changing to benefit them until they can make money off riders and their customers. And that’s their end games. Customers having no choice to buy through them. And riders having no choice but to be their slaves.",2,2020-04-06,13:39:46

"Thank you OP for bringing this up. I personally think raising the requirements and lowering the incentives (last week was 90 trips for 140bucks but this week its 95 trips for 135bucks) was absolutely an asshole move from Grab. And their reasoning for making it harder to earn the incentive? Because of their ""annual report"" which says that majority of riders already hit the AR/CR of 90/10. Wtf???? Im absolutely confident thats not the case for us cyclists and walkers because we cant afford to keep going unreasonable distances whenever the app fucks up. If its the case for motorcyclists, sure, apply it to them, and not across the board, which affects those who are already struggling to hit their hard earned incentives. Tbh, i see this more as an excuse not to give these payouts to their riders even though we have been working tirelessly to deliver and hit that incentive they have been promising.

>Commission Fees from merchants on GrabFood  
As far as we know, there have been no plans to increase commission fees during this period. We would appreciate it if you could let us know the name of the merchant so that we can take a look and check internally on this.  
  
>  
>Platform Fee:  
We made the announcement on the 12th of March, through an in-app message under the subject title ‘Service fees for GrabFood deliveries’. The feature is currently being rolled out to all users progressively.  
  
>  
>About that Reddit thread about GrabFood:  
Allow us to clarify that we did not cut the base fare for our delivery-partners. What happened to the delivery-partners over the weekend was a bug that has since been fixed on Saturday evening. As of writing, all the deliver-partners have been compensated accordingly for their work.  
Grocery Vouchers deducted from driver-partners wallet  
There was no secret deduction of any sort. What you and your reader have described is the Shop Now Pay Later programme that we rolled out to some of our driver-partners. This is a voucher financing scheme that lets our driver-partners purchase grocery vouchers upfront from us which they can repay over 13 weeks. This mechanic was made clear to driver-partners when they chose to opt-in for the programme.

"Question for OP:'

* Without incentives/ reduction of distances will you still consider delivering food w/ GF?

* Has any restaurant partner shared if their comm structure have decreased due to Covid?

* Has the increased distance of delivery affected your earnings eg: before distance increase u earn $X per week on average, now u earn $Y on average

Considering right now 3 low level moving parts in this business (GF):

* Rider (No issue on supply, if you don't want to do someone else will based on current market conditions)
* Restaurant (Business heavily impacted due to takeaway only, earnings 50% or even lower currently before 7/4 dine in ban)
* Customer (Increasing in order, ideally order volume grows in tandem to supply growth for motor vehicles)

The platform will definitely try its best not to ""temp offline"" due to supply shortages as it impacts restaurants ability to receive orders and further impact their earnings, which results in less money from commissions to sustain it's supply base.

Currently out of the 3 parts mentioned above, riders have the most bandwidth in terms of stretching to ensure sustainability of the food delivery ecosystem in which many restaurants will be forced to shut down earlier if pressure is not alleviated on their end.

* Platform needs to be sustainable for restaurants to get orders
* Restaurants as of today Definitely need orders/ delivery else no need for riders or platform if it goes belly up
* Riders are the commodity needed to deliver the food

Sucks that riders get the short end of the stick here, but as consumers have you ordered from D'Roo/ Foodpanda? Competition only occurs when customers allow it to happen by supporting the other players in the market.",1,2020-04-06,10:06:42

"Basically this. 

Similar to many businesses, companies are cutting costs on areas that generate the main bulk of revenue on them, whether be it reduced/same/increased levels of profit so that they can use it to cover for the ailing side of the business. 

An example would be a hotel my friend is working at. He works at the bar in the hotel. Business is booming since covid, but due to the hotel occupancy rate taking a huge hit; they cut their part timers off even though the number of customers coming in has increased. It’s the same for grab, when I converse with the drivers once in a while, they told me that they are barely covering the costs of car rental, let alone making ends meet even before the circuit breaker.

Also, they realised that even with the increase in demand in orders, they can cut the earnings from their riders simply because too many people just want to get a job at this point with low demands from them.

The combination of both would mean that there’s no reason why any businesses facing this would not act the same way as Grab, especially when they operate under the venture capitalist model.",27,2020-04-06,08:08:24

"Ok fine, if Grab wants to play this game:

- Base fees:

Yes they absolutely decreased base fees. Any rider who's been working for at least a month can attest to that. Notwithstanding the fact that there was a glitch in fares on Saturday, every rider here has concrete proof that fares have dropped - on my side, I have a 0.98km trip which I completed on 23 Mar - I was paid $4.80 for that delivery. I completed another delivery on 5 Apr which was 1.04km, and I was paid $4.70 for that trip. Both trips happened in the same zone, starting from the exact same merchant. I don't know what Grab's definition of ""cut the base fare"" is, but any primary schooler can tell you that $4.80 > $4.70, and 0.98km < 1.04km - essentially, I travelled a longer distance and got paid less. If you're interested to see the screenshots of the 2 trips, drop me a PM and I'll be more than happy to share it with you.

I can't believe Grab is still trying to lie to people when we riders have black and white proof that fares have dropped.

EDIT - more evidence: I did a trip on 1.21km trip on 21 Mar for $4.90. On Tuesday (7 Apr), I did a 1.41km trip for $4.70. Today (9 Apr), I did a 1.52km trip for $4.80. P sure that's also a drop.",1,2020-04-09,19:57:54
"Not OP, but am part time/weekend grab cyclist for grabfood.

*- Without incentives/ reduction of distances will you still consider delivering food w/ GF?*

Unfortunately yes, because it is tough to find a job that grants this amount of flexiblity. The pay is not the best - but incentives really pushed you to do more orders and distances being >4km is a major gripe for me. Fucked up my knees doing all those uphill end of the world orders. 

- *Has any restaurant partner shared if their comm structure have decreased due to Covid?*

No contact with restaurant partners - communications and price setting between them and grab I believe are on an individual agreement basis. Someone more informed can correct me.

- *Has the increased distance of delivery affected your earnings eg: before distance increase u earn $X per week on average, now u earn $Y on average*

Yes, on average the payout is about 10 dollars lesser a day. (short) Orders that used to pay a minimum of 5 now pay about 4.5. (long) Orders that used to pay ~6.5 now pay about 5.9/6. This multiplied by 12 and reduction of incentives ($10 for 12 deliveries) makes us lose about ~$20 a day from the changes. Imagine working full time, this is significant (20*30 assuming working whole month at *minimum* orders is 600 dollars dip in earnings.",3,2020-04-06,11:22:36
"Quite an appropriate flair considering your questions haha

1. Incentives make up a large part of our pay (I'd daresay more than 30% based on my earnings), so if Grab completely removes incentives without raising base pay, I suspect there'll be a exodus of riders. As for distance reductions, it's really a suck thumb thing for us - damned if we do (customer complain food cold), damned if we don't (incentives affected).

2. I haven't heard any restaurant mention decreased comms.

"The thing is, in the instance for Grab, hailing services generate the main bulk of their income. Of course they do cut as much costs they can from it, but there is a limit to how much you can cut, and given the current situation in Singapore, they are still facing losses/massive losses. To mitigate some of the losses, there’s where food delivery comes in.

Right now, they are not at a stage where they can aggressively expand market share due to losses incurred. Given the current situation, maintaining status quo on the customer side, given the increasing reliance on food delivery would mean they are generating more revenue without the need to do anything at all. Thus comes cost cutting.

When they decide to lower incentives and potential income for riders, would it mean that they would face a shortage in riders? With the current job situation in Singapore, many people are swarming into transport(grab, taxi) and food delivery sectors. However, the current group of transport drivers are barely covering costs in the first place, thus Grab has stopped accepting new Grab drivers, let alone people not even wanting to enter the industry due to minimal income/potential losses, thus most people are trying to enter food delivery now. Even with reduced incentives, there are more potential riders available right now. Thus they can afford to save costs, yet be able to retain enough riders to cope with increased demand. Thus it would be a sensible approach to cut costs in the area they are profiting from since it won’t/will barely cause any drop in revenue at all.",2,2020-04-06,10:41:56

But our cut is generally 4 to 6 dollars on average depending on distance. Distance is very important as it determines how long you get between orders as a rider.

For stalls, someone more informed can chime in but their profit margin on food items is adjusted to their preference on the app, after which grab takes commission from them (how this is structured I have zero clue)

Overhead costs for grab probably is high, not going to discount that. So this could play a key part. If they are making losses per order then it makes sense to increase cost, however they could still maintain the same rider earnings, which was the point of this thread.",2,2020-04-06,12:52:41

"Grab is living up to its name as a tech disrupters indeed.

They fucked their partners up with lower base fees. The average job is much less than $5/delivery now. 

They squeeze in stacked orders so you effectively get even lesser collecting and delivering 2 orders citing the deliveries are along the way (which in most cases are NOT! And to customers that are assigned last in the queue, good luck to you because if your rider gets stuck in a McD/BBT queue in between, you can wait forever for your quick fix order meal.) 

The incentives are harder to attain with higher standards and they recently came up with the silliest of team missions. I didn’t even bother to participate in it. 

They then misled the public with the stupid pizza pi chart in which they conveniently grouped the delivery fee into the pi, making it seem like the riders are taking over a quarter of the food order while they take less! The delivery fee is not supposed to be in the consideration of the pi chart.

And I don’t know why ST came up with reports of TOP riders earning 7k (deliveroo) and 5k (Grab) for March. I hope you guys still remember their stories of Grabdrivers earning 7-8k a month?! Ha ha ha.

It is just business. These kind of vouchers and subcriptions creates the illlusion that they had loyal customers which translates to growth so that they had excuses to their investors to inject more funds.

"I'm a Deliveroo Plus subscriber, after the work from home situation started, I wanted to sign up for Grab's subscription too since they have pretty much all the restaurants that Deliveroo has, and so many more.

When I couldn't find it as an option, I called their Customer Care line, and asked them about not being able to see the Subscription. The person told me where to find it (like tap here and tap there) - I told them I know where it is, I don't see the GrabFood subscription. So then the representative said they'd send me a link, and using that I can get it.

The idiot in me was like, ""Oh wow, I've been a Platinum member for 2+ years, they're going to give me the subscription even though it's not available because I've given them so much business and they want to show appreciation.""

LOOOOOOOL

Obviously the link took me to the same page in the app with no subscription, and I called them back because I'm a stubborn asshole. Again the same thing, and this time they passed me off to a different rep, who said that it's been discontinued. When I asked why, all they'd say is that if it ever comes back, you'll know. That's it. It obviously isn't the person who made the decision, so no point arguing.

So much for all those bullshit, ""**We're here for you in these trying times**"" e-mails.

I'm glad I didn't cancel my Deliveroo Plus subscription. Delivery is free, and even though the choices of restaurants is a lot less, I'd much rather be their customer. I signed up when the subscription fee was $11/month. When Deliveroo changed it to $14 later, they kept the old customers on $11. No guesses for thinking what Grab would have done in the same situation. They would probably have charged an extra $3/month to make up for the lost revenue.

Touch your heart my dear GF riders, deep down you know Grab will never prioritise you in its business. Lol you are never their business partner, you are the slave worker who has to work under the hot sun and face off the brutal honesty that is the front line service. 
GF riders always fail to realise that their so called ricebowl will always be challenge and get eaten up by other competitors. 
Recently, it was the new GC drivers. Surge in new riders due to many losing their main income. Yet Grab keep pumping in more riders. Your incentives are gone (lowered). 
Now with more skewed perceptions by the public with recent sagas, do you really want to be loyal to Grab?

"Could this be because Grab has alrd processed the payment and hence MUST fulfil the order?

The concept of a payment or transaction, is to exchange money for services rendered.

In situations like delivery, the transaction can only be completed by delayed fulfilment. And since payment has already been processed, GrabFood MUST fulfil their role (the reason for payment) which is to pass the order to the third party (BBT shop in this case) to fulfil, and upon that completion, pass to the GrabFood rider to deliver to the payer; thereby completing Grab’s end of the transaction.

Grab should have further control over every step to refund if cannot be completed at various stages, seemingly not built into their platform.

For completeness of argument and to provide my own counter thesis, I would also like to add that while we should all be kind to Grab and understand that such a situation may be unforeseen (we are in unprecedented times after all), this excuse is unacceptable for a company that can build surge pricing but not a way for third parties to manage their own incoming orders.

Imagine just 10 orders come in, but each order 4 cups, thats 40 cups to prepare. By the time u realize how big the orders are, too late,  you are swamped with more orders. Before u can pause the system, u are probably left with a backlog of 20-30 ordera each 3-4 cups.

Even if they move away, they'll probably just get another order from some other bbt place (because of the sheer volume), then the whole waiting game restarts.

No, normal businesses aren't obliged to fulfill orders even if ""payment"" has been made — look at the [many cases of pricing mistakes](https://www.singaporelawblog.sg/blog/article/65).

Of course, as Grab controls the platform, they are free to penalise either the store or consumer as they see fit — and the most straightforward way for them to settle any dispute is to say that ""they're banned from using our platform"".

That's why you always see hoards of Grabfood riders waiting but rarely Foodpanda or Deliveroo. Because the latter 2 only ping riders when the food is close to ready (i.e. the estimated pickup time). Grab pings riders first, and only when the rider has accepted, will they send the order to the merchant.

Just cos some riders go offline after cancelling doesn't mean Grab can't simply pile those cancelled orders onto the riders who're already waiting (and pay them less per trip too). Riders cannot win in a situation like this.",-1,2020-04-23,10:47:53

"Well in my opinion, why is there such a huge dependency on Grab or for it to change their system? Sure, you're right that it has happening more and more in the past few weeks. Their system can always be improved.

But the Grab partners, they had the option of not working with Grab. There's alternatives, or you can just not engage food delivery tech services.

The customers also want the luxury of not queuing, not going to buy food, and want these services at a cheap, affordable price. They don't want to wait too long too.

The grab delivery riders they want to earn income at their own time. They're afraid to cancel orders in fear of their ratings or whatnot.

Everyone is just trying to make a quick buck/live life. And as I've said, Grab probably isn't even profitable yet, especially in the GrabFood aspect. To me it just seems like people hating on other people, yet all are in the same sinking ship. 

Could Grab have an improved system? Yes. But are they purely at fault? If they didn't have a function for partners to not accept orders, couldn't the riders call it an early day or just cancel? What's there to be said about customers who knowingly try to get orders when these vendors are so packed?

I'm just thinking there's lessons to be learnt, and ways we can all improve ourselves on in these situations. The sooner we acknowledge that we shouldn't always point and let one party solely bear the brunt of responsibility, the sooner we can progress as a society. Just my opinion.",2,2020-04-23,11:25:05
"I don’t think that’s how it works. I had an order that the merchant accepted already but they can’t find a driver. 

And I’m not sure if it’s fair to compare the number of drivers waiting like that cause I also rarely see Deliveroo and foodpanda drivers on the road. 

If grab was so terrible, why won’t Drivers switch to foodpanda or Deliveroo instead?",-1,2020-04-23,11:03:58

The legal definition is the only one that matters when it comes to defining what rights you have as someone working for Grab. To everyone.,1,2020-04-23,18:09:43
"Haha yeah I know lots of people get duped by the initial screen saying that they're finding a driver and restaurant is preparing your order - that's straight up false. Merchants don't receive an order until riders accept - I've tested this with multiple merchants when I stand at their counter, they don't see the order until I (as a rider) press accept, only then does their orange devide start ringing.

As a Deliveroo rider, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any food. But on Grab, waits above 10min are the norm rather than the exception.

As long as Grab cannot find a driver within 30min at all, they'll cancel your order without the merchant ever receiving said order. I guess it does have an upside - lesser food wastage from not being able to find someone to deliver. And as long as 1 rider has accepted and cancelled, the order will stay in the system forever and they'll find someone to deliver it.

Riders stick with Grabfood only because of flexibility and demand - Foodpanda riders need to book shifts (and get penalised for not attending them), Deliveroo just doesn't seem to be well know by consumers (super low demand on Deliveroo outside of town) and they're restricting hiring - right now Grab is the only one that's freeflow accepting applications, allows riders to online and offline as they please, and has demand from consumers.",3,2020-04-23,11:10:41
"Precisely! Notice that they don’t even bother coming out to mediate between drivers and merchants when there’s a conflict. 

But when there’s a threat to their bottom line (recent merchants complaining about grab’s up to 30% cut), their PR machine goes into overgear to explain why they deserve such a big cut for doing fuck all.",2,2020-04-23,15:31:23
"Yeah but how many apps will test for a pandemic.
Usually they test app load but merchant load has to be determined by them themselves because for all grab knows, this Restaurant has a Super big kitchen with a lot of employees. 

But imo they need to provide more backup options to stop taking orders if the temporary pause feature is not working.",-2,2020-04-23,13:46:50
"In the sense that the average Grab worker will just click through the terms and conditions without reading and have the mindset ""I do job, I get cash, nothing else.""

"Oh they must have changed it because of the food wastage situation. I remember having an order that couldn’t find a driver and I called the restaurant they said the food is already ready. So I went down to collect it and pay directly, if not quite sad for the restaurant. 

Looks like pros and cons whichever way they go, I would not want the restaurant to start preparing the food only for there to be no drivers as well. Not sure what the middle ground here can be.

Thanks for sharing btw! Sounds like the food delivery companies are all trying out different ways to tackle supply and demand. Time will tell who has the right solution I suppose.",2,2020-04-23,11:17:20

"Which is on the workers, not Grab. What is needed is more education of these workers so they understand what they're signing up to. In fact, even if they're specifically told the words ""Please note that you are a contractor of Grab, not an employee"" many people will fail to comprehend what that means and sign up anyway. Again, it's not a failure of the contracting company in these circumstances.",1,2020-04-23,18:56:45
"Yeah I believe they changed it after integrating Grabfood into their main app - the old merchant app allowed merchant to select their estimated prep time.

A hybrid method would be best imo - during the day when supply of riders is sufficient, the Foodpanda/Deliveroo system of pinging riders near pickup time would be best for efficiency. Late at night (say 11pm-7am) when there's v few riders on the road, the Grab system would ensure someone would collect the order thus cutting down on potential wastage. But that's also the most technically difficult to implement.",0,2020-04-23,11:22:20
"All I’m saying is that they have a temporary pause feature on the app. On normal days, I assume merchants manage fine by pausing the app when they are too busy - since this hasn’t been a problem before.

"The takeaway is that Grab's prior levels of commission rates to riders, F&B stalls and consumers have never been sustainable. This is the key takeaway. The branch will have to break somewhere:

1. F&B's profit margins (amount earned after all the fees and commission are subtracted which may make it unsustainable for them)

2. Riders' fees and incentives (Not worth for bike riders, hard to earn a decent living after petrol for the motorcyclists)

3. Grab's profit margins (Asking a for-profit company to do that is just not gonna happen because they have a responsibility towards their shareholders too)

4. Customers' spending power (All these problems would disappear if customers was simply willing to pay more but how many can afford to? We can save the F&B stalls by dabao-ing in person but Grab and riders would be shafted and it'd also go against the spirit of current Circuit Breaker measures.

Then, there's additional delivery fee. And the food usually comes not as appetizing as it does if I just buy it myself and brought it home. 

My clients in the F&B industry will complain about grab / food delivery platforms with their predatory tactics. In the end, the F&B outlets, unless they're big enough (like the golden arches), will suffer at the hands of the platforms.

"Actually from this equation, based on recurring manpower operating cost per stakeholder type:

1. Restaurant (Assume 10 person)
2. Rider (1 person)
3. Platform (Restaurant support, Rider support, Tech (app), Tech (infrastructure), Sales (to get new vendors), photography, restaurant logistics, marketplace management, Operations, Supply chain (for device and equipment), Finance (Billing), Marketing, Data team, Security team etc.

Breakdown of earnings:

1. Restaurant earns $17.55
2. Grab Driver earns $8 (Assume), lets be real, riders won't accept this order unless forced to do so due to the 8km distance, will be grabcar drivers.
3. Delivery app $22.7 - $8 = $14.7

Ultimately in this pricing structure all parties must be agreeable to the model. No one party really gives a shit as long as each other party is able to derive value to sustain their own needs.
  
Shit happens when profit structure prove unsustainable for any one party. Like i mentioned in an earlier post on another thread, riders are the expandable commodity in the current environment.

Restaurants main goal is to tide over this shitshow of Covid lockdown + explore inhouse / contracted delivery.

Platform main goal is to onboard as many restaurants as possible and ensure minimal problems in order assignment to riders/ fulfilment. 

Moral of the story: STAY THE FUCK HOME BECAUSE

1. Restaurants can earn 100% of the profit pie once this situation becomes better to allow walk-ins
2. Grabfood drivers go back to Grabcar so riders get orders
3. Platform goes back to their normal operational levels 

Lastly i would like to add, if possible, restaurants should focus on making dishes that survive better while being delivered and find their competitive edge/ offering against their local competitors (Eg: Introduce sides rather than only selling a protein + carb combo/ see what cuisine type is lacking in the area and make it happen)",5,2020-04-15,09:26:56

The lawsuit alleges that these companies — including Seamless, which is owned by Grubhub, and Caviar, which is owned by DoorDash — place restaurants in a tough spot with the commission, and that restaurants in turn are forced to charge customers more to make up for those costs.

"Food delivery apps provide a low bar of entry for riders. The apps do simplify the workflow of delivery. You can walk, kickscooter, cycle with an unpowered bike. To work directly with a f&b business, you have to have a minimum of an ebike and have some experience riding. 

Riders are now struggling to get enough orders from customers, and every day more riders come aboard. We need to support these out of work riders and order more from apps. 

Do order from local businesses near your place so riders can have a quick delivery. We're too poor to order food, so idk how to save costs. But you can sign up for multiple accounts in your household to get the various forms of discounted delivery once you run out. Ordering (slightly) before and after peak periods would let riders earn for more hours, reduce their waiting time and the stall's prep time. 

Grab's food delivery service is now subsidising its transport services. Foodpanda and deliveroo should take the lead and follow the example of its American counterparts who are at least doing something. This is their opportunity to gain marketshare against the dominant player. 

The minimum that can be done is deferring commission charges, which isn't ideal as restaurants still have to pay afterwards. Doordash is waiving commission fees for new to platform restaurants for 30 days and takeout fees for all restaurants, as well as halving commission fees for restaurants with 5 or less locations until the end of May.

When you use Grab, you pay for massive overheads. You subsidize other parts of their “empire” that they want to price aggressively to gain market share. You fund their ubiquitous marketing. You pay for the dividends going to the shareholders.

With a non-profit, you could operate the same island-wide service at cost, pay all parties involved (lean back office staff, delivery drivers) a fair wage, and have not an extra penny in overhead (no marketing, no dividends, no ancillary business, etc). The cost to F&B outlets would be considerably less, and any surplus at the end of the year would be reinvested in improving the performance and lowering the cost-to-serve.

The fact that, even without COVID, they'll nuke plenty of small eateries as they inevitably go down was entirely foreseeable and deliberately ignored because Sili Valley mentality rules real and pseudo-tech companies.

I gave up on Grab completely after being unable to contact a human to solve a problem with my credit card charges several months ago; I don't really miss it. I'd settled on FoodPanda as the least odious choice available locally; I see I'll have to reevaluate.",1,2020-04-15,20:47:52
"Making a website with payment integration via Stripe or other payment gateways? 

With all the tools available online, anyone with adequete google skills can do it in hours with zero expertise (Had a friend who bought their own domain and set up their online projects portfolio within a couple hours).

Finding riders to take the orders and deliver, while paying an agreeable amount?

Getting enough riders might require quite a lot of publicity, and the fees they receive must be at least comparable to the other delivery services in order for them to even consider. 

But if NUS/NTU students can set up and maintain a solid network of peer-to-peer deliveries (check their telegram pages), I believe it can be done as well outside of campuses, if there is enough demand for it.

"Delivery models like grab, foodpanda and deliveroo are inherently unprofitable even at 'scale'. Grubhub, which is more of a food delivery aggregator (drivers are from the restaurants) made this clear in their [investor letter last year](https://s2.q4cdn.com/772508021/files/doc_financials/2019/q3/October-2019-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) that what these companies are doing is just not sustainable in the long term.

The only road to profitability is:

1. Complete market monopoly resulting in raising delivery fees for the customers or the merchants. This may not even be possible as new unprofitable disruptors will just join the market since barriers are low. 
2. Some other way to drastically reduce the cost of delivery: robot delivery or some crazy good route optimization.. but these are all still ages away and come with physical limitations.

My take is that delivery fees will shoot up eventually, and customers will just have to accept it. Either that or they all go bust and get replaced by some new start-up funded with deep pockets.",11,2020-04-15,14:43:10
"I work for a non-profit association with hundreds of members. Just because it’s an industry association doesn’t mean everyone has a voice. Like every corporate, it has governance mechanisms in place, with a Board, a Chairman, an executive team, various working groups to address technical aspects, etc. The only thing it doesn’t have is a profit motive and shareholders to pay dividends to. It’s sole purpose is to serve its members, and it works very well. Of course its possible.",1,2020-04-15,19:05:37
"I’m not limiting this to hawkers. I’m talking about a professional app that allows itemized menu posting, order taking, transaction processing, and delivery guidance for drivers. Essentially the same functional scope that Grab, FoodPanda, Deliveroo etc offer. The building blocks (technology-wise) exist in the form of libraries. But if you take away the overhead and dividends, you can turn the economic equation around.

"Yes but grab has to take a cut because they are providing a delivery service for these restaurants no? They take some from the restaurant and some from the customers for the delivery service and then that goes to the Drivers and grab. 

If the restaurant choose to increase price on grab to cover their share of the delivery cost, then everything goes to the customer. 

I have friends with restaurants negotiating lower cuts and then absorbing the cost for delivery orders instead",16,2020-04-15,09:08:26
"True.

A small eatery near me absorbs the costs and sells at the same price for Grab/physical customers, and all I can say is that their business has been booming since - in this case they're seeing it as gaining NEW customers that otherwise wouldn't have patronised them, instead of seeing it as losing 30% to delivery apps when regular patrons order online instead.

"Most of the companies are making a loss because part of the commissions they are taking from restaurants go to the delivery folks on Top of the delivery fees the customer pay. and they still have to pay for the service they provide which is customer support, driver fleet management etc.

"Yes. The issue is marginal cost is high. Each delivery ride is costly especially for perishable goods like meals which have to be delivered in 30 min within ordering - this limits route optimization which often lowers cost. (Ie I can consolidate all orders from ABC restaurant to deliver to Block 123 residents all at once.)

If marginal costs are high and unit economics are fundamentally unprofitable, then scaling WORSENS the problem. Scale only helps if there are high fixed costs and low marginal costs. 

Maybe a complete monopoly may help but honestly I think they either need to have
- high minimum order size 
- high fixed delivery fee 

You see most f&b outlets who are going it alone are doing both. It fundamentally doesn’t make sense for a human being to spend 5-15 min riding to a restaurant and another 5-15 minutes riding to your place to deliver a $10 meal.",3,2020-04-15,17:56:05
"Non-profit associations are not exactly the same as a non-profit delivery company though.

A non-profit delivery company on the other hand directly impacts the bottom line of its members in a huge way so everyone has a lot of skin in the game, and the dynamics are completely different.",3,2020-04-15,19:14:04
"Exactly. Grab isn't just a delivery service. They are pretty much a POS system in a sense too. Subscribing to Grab pretty much guarantees that your restaurant don't have to manage that part. No need to hire someone who can drive, don't need to plan delivery routes or make a roster.
