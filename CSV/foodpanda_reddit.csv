Hey bro- how much is the light? Would like to buy one for you via lazada and shopee. Just to thank delivery riders for their hard work. The lot of you got us through some tough times last year. Just reach out to me,986,2021-03-03,21:15:13
"hey OP, do let us know if you ended work safely today. I dont really use food delivery that often but recognise how hard you guys work...would be happy to get you a replacement torchlight",129,2021-03-03,21:36:18
Just cover it with a cloth face-mask. Probably no one will dare touch it.,105,2021-03-03,21:20:51
"Make a police report. If there are CCTVs anywhere that caught where the thief went then he can be caught. Sometimes they can even trace the thief all the way back to his home. I know its a very big hassle for just a torchlight, but if everyone do this then it will be hard to steal things in future.",240,2021-03-03,20:55:06

"Some riders have headlights strapped on their upper arm and forehead. The ones on their arms are usually flashing. That might be an option to consider since the light will be on you at all times. Those are fairly affordable and can be found at Daiso.

"I'll echo what some others have already said, to make a police report. Even if they fail to solve your particular case, it will add a mark on that area and no Police Station wants to be the one with the most active ""crime-zone"". Patrols will increase, and hopefully should the thief attempt another crime, will get caught and save the next victim.

EDIT\] Best outcome of course is they catch the bugger and return your torchlight, but regardless, just make a police report.",58,2021-03-03,21:13:09
What's wrong with these people? Sorry it happened to you man,18,2021-03-03,20:40:02

"Hey! You should get those easily detachable kind of bike light. I had an expensive $30 one which was stolen one day too. Just remember to make it a habit to detach those modules when you get off the bike. Might be a hassle but definitely less than if you had to buy a new one.

Like why do people even steal a torchlight FFS,3,2021-03-04,09:22:15
The thief isn't desperate. The consequences to the victim potentially are huge.  The punishment in this and other cases where the motivation is so undeserving of sympathy should not have a possibility to be light in spite of the torch not being super expensive itself. Damage to society as a whole by letting this kind of nonsense go easily is far worse than the face value.,3,2021-03-04,12:05:13

"I use [this light from AliExpress,](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33052501051.html) $15, mounts using a GoPro mount. They sell it with these dual out front mounts that also take a Garmin which is what I use but you can get [little individual mounts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32516607971.html) for it too if you don't have a Garmin, only a few dollars. That light is great, too, it has an actual good pattern with a vertical cut-off so the light goes onto the road, not into oncoming motorists' eyes.

This uses an allen key for attachment, they *could* still steal it if they had one but it's much less likely. You could also replace the regular allen-head bolt with a [security bolt](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33048888632.html), these just use a Torx head with a pin that you need a [particular tool](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000687541265.html) to remove, that a random opportunist is very unlikely to be carrying.

The other alternative is to take it off. There are mounts [that are open to the top](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32735169560.html) that it's much easier to to pull the light out of quickly. If you are taking it on and off constantly, it has to be super-easy to do or you will get frustrated or not do it.

Sometimes i wish these apps can inform customers if a particular restaurants have a high demand or if they are short of riders in a certain areas.

This would at least inform customers of their shortage of riders or if the restaurants has high demand so that customers can switch to grab/deliveroo or used other method.

Some restaurants can also be at fault for missing order/certain items has gone out ot stock,something that happen last year when my dad ordered prata for breakfast,only to receive some items missing.he tried to contact the CS,but they can't help it if the restaurant not willing to admit the mistakes.No refund as of now.",2,2021-03-18,20:34:50

The best part was,the receipt charged the total cost instead of the total cost of the snack.If i remember last time,you spend above $15 got free delivery.End up,i make a complained & ask for a refund for the missing item.

Interesting thing is that the PSA says any interest earned from e-wallet moneys should accrue to the user unless otherwise agreed.

The agent then proceed to tell me I can either get a refund of $3, or a compensation voucher of $5 that can be use for future orders. 

Of course like any sane customer with a brain, that doesn't even make any sense. Why would I, who received the wrong items accept that offer, the $3 refund in fact only covers the cost of the drink that I actually received correctly. I questioned the agent, he/she then proceed to say ""yes and that's why i asked if you received the order partially, and you said yes"". Like cmon, all they are trying to do is to fish for a response that can let them refund as little as possible.

"> # Police investigating case of 'harassment' involving foodpanda delivery orders at Joo Seng

> SINGAPORE: The police are investigating a case of ""intentional harassment"" involving foodpanda delivery orders that were sent to a Housing Board flat in Joo Seng, after a resident posted photos about ""prank orders"".

> The police said they were alerted to the incident at Block 7 Upper Aljunied Lane on Friday (Feb 19) at about 7.30pm.

> Photos posted on Facebook on Friday night showed several foodpanda delivery riders, wearing the company's pink shirt, gathered at the foot of a housing block.

> Police officers can also be seen in the photos, which were posted by a user who said she is a resident of the estate.

> ""Prank orders according to one of them,"" she wrote.

> Foodpanda is looking into the matter, a spokesperson for the company told CNA on Saturday.

> When asked about whether they were prank orders and if any payment was made for the orders, foodpanda said: ""The cash on delivery option is offered for users who may not have access to cashless payment options so as to offer an inclusive service to our customers.

> ""We appeal for the responsible use of food delivery services and cash on delivery option in consideration of food delivery riders who are working hard round the clock to deliver hot food to our homes.""

> 

> Advertisement

> In April last year, SPF issued an advisory saying that unlicensed moneylenders have increasingly been making use of food delivery services to harass debtors.

> ""The unlicensed moneylenders would order large quantities of food or make multiple orders on the same day, and arrange for the food to be delivered to the debtors' homes, often late at night,"" police said.

> Food was sometimes delivered to debtors' relatives. The food delivery rider would then request payment from the debtors or recipients of the orders, said SPF.

> 

> ""Those who deliberately cause annoyance and disruption to public sense of safety, peace and security will be arrested and dealt with severely in accordance with the law,"" the police said then.

• all restaurants in the area are now closed because of the delay caused

I wish I could say this was a one off thing but it’s happened at least 4-5 times where food is just not delivered after a 2 hour wait. Wait times just seem to get longer and longer and CS is pretty much useless.

Because other than their customer service, everything else is pretty good, and I didn't see a real need to be too upset over the customer service that I probably interact with once every twenty orders. It was until the negative events became closer to each other recently and little was done to resolve it that I've decided that I've come to an end with fp.

"Uber, Grab, and all of their variants are basically running on a bubble created by *unconventional* monetary policy: Quantitative Easing by the USA's Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan or Negative Interest rate by the European Central Bank. There is basically so much practically zero interest loans on the market today that companies that haven't make a cent of profit still remain solvent. This is not unusual, for example, Airbus ran on a loss for decades chipping away Boeing market share; it could do this because France and Germany considered civilian airframe design and manufacturing to be important enough of a strategic concern that they use government funding to keep Airbus afloat. What exactly is the strategic asset of Uber and Grab for the US government?

In practice, this means a transfer of money from savers (in the regime of negative interest rate your money evaporate at the negative rate + inflation rate) to investors, which Central Bankers worldwide hope will trickle down to workers, which in all honesty, do; though in a rather inefficient manner.

Historical records showed that this is a bad idea. US Federal Reserve basically announced recently that they will go pedal to the metal with the money printing, consequences be damned. Their reasoning is simple: typically, they expect inflation to rise and employment rate will fall, but since neither has happened, they will continue.

By the way, you are still wrong about corporate debt I/r vs MP induced I/r.  Corporate debt interest is always significantly higher because the payments are non-guaranteed and have higher risk.

">Except that we’ve just experienced the greatest bull run in the history of the world?  And GME popped on Friday because the Fed has been pushing down interest rates?

Exactly. Central Banks made money really cheap, bought up shares, stocks, and assets and push their prices up. The bull run has everything to do with their policy and nothing to do with any fundamentals. One adage of investment has been ""time in the market beats timing the market"" and ""the stock market will go up in the long run"". The long-term price movement of stocks and assets since 2008 or so has everything to do with Central Banks' balance sheet.

Retail investors can indeed speculate and drive very short-term movements but in the long run, it's up to the Central banks.

>institutional investor climate

When an institutional investor, and the biggest owners are Central Banks, it's impossible that they don't affect stock prices in anyway. Of course they do. Same issue with passive and index funds. Their assumptions that their actions will have negligible effects on the price is OK when they are small but once they go to dominate the market, it's impossible that their actions isn't affecting the market. Central Banks couldn't push trillions worth of liquidity into the market without driving up prices. Economics fundamentals and company performance has nothing to do with stock price anymore.

Orthodox economics is in the post-realism realm: their predictions and theories have no relation with reality. They couldn't predict shit. So why bother studying it?",3,2021-01-24,13:19:58
"> The bull run has everything to do with their policy and nothing to do with any fundamentals

Except that many of the stocks are still not recovered from pre Covid levels, and most that are up are just the safe stocks like FAANG or sectors that managed to profit during Covid?  Companies like PDD, BABA, AMZN, JMIA (e commerce), freelancing companies, digital payment services (e.g. PYPL, SQ, SE) are up (4x) because of government FP or MP? Really bruh?  It’s nothing to do with fundamentals?   

Macroeconomics play a big part in finance, but not the way you think.  It’s not the Fed or Central banks that is pushing stocks up, it’s the way the stock favourites have changed in a new Covid era.  Most stocks, as I’ve said, are still not recovered and not profiting off Covid.  The bull market, which I called a market, just actually refers to specific sectors and  firms.

> orthodox economics... couldn’t predict shit

This is your only point that I partially agree with, but I would like to point out that the reality that most people refuse to acknowledge is that most economics you learn in university is useless.  It’s too much theory and modelling and too little application on any side.  The economics academia scene in SG is pretty disappointing imho. 

It is also ironic that you think economic fundamentals and company performance has nothing to do with stock price, when your approach of what economic fundamentals is is wrong in the first place.  The economic fundamentals in a Covid era has benefitted some winners and chose some losers.  It’s as common sense as that and the only reason why you cannot see this is because of the bullshit education system and how it obfuscates everything with theoretical economics.",-1,2021-01-24,14:14:09
">  Companies like PDD, BABA, AMZN, JMIA (e commerce), freelancing companies, digital payment services (e.g. PYPL, SQ, SE) are up (4x) because of government FP or MP? Really bruh? It’s nothing to do with fundamentals?

Without Central Banks actions, their gains would have been much smaller and there would also be a lot more bankruptcies and drive a Great Depression-style mania. In that maniac environment, people would also spend less.",2,2021-01-24,14:36:05

"I have to say, all three have sucked at various points in time. 

Deliveroo has, more than once, not delivered orders because they could not find riders. They just kept changing the estimated arrival time until we cancelled (I’m talking teatime stuff for office ordered at 2pm that hasn’t arrived after 4pm and they still have no rider).

Foodpanda makes it insanely difficult to find the help chat, and then they go in these logical loops and keep doing stupid shit. Shit so stupid i was convinced the guy on the other side was a bot. And every time we disconnected because my screen locked while waiting for a reply, I got a new dumbass and had to repeat myself over and over. I usually only get a refund after I’ve wasted more than an hour. (Eg Foodpanda placed an order at a restaurant that was closed and replaced by a totally different restaurant, this was discovered by my rider who went to pick up the order and realised there was no such shop, and the customer service guy assured me my order would be delivered, called the rider and told him to go back, and called the ex employee of the restaurant and told him to prepare the order. When the rider called me back again I had to repeat my story. Took nearly 2 hours on the phone to get my $30 back). But they are often cheaper than grab.

Grab was only good because they had vouchers that drove down the cost of delivery. Once the vouchers are gone probably won’t use it except for self pickup.",9,2020-11-30,19:52:28

Second time: we ordered at 10am and they delivered at 1pm, again getting the order partially wrong. Third time was the same. We then abandoned them completely.

Basically I helped my aunt order food via her Grab app for about 3 pax so it is a considerable amount of food. Address input was not fully complete (no unit number) and because my aunt is new to this whole food ordering thing she did not monitor her phone at all after we placed the order. Delivery man called twice, she did not hear her phone to pick it up. Around 10min passed before we realised and by then the whole transaction had been cancelled from Grab's end and there was no way we could call the delivery man back. Food did not arrive at all and Grab refused to give us refund. Thoughts? Should they have done so out of goodwill? Afterall we made payment for food that we did not receive at all.

> One Foodpanda delivery rider recently received a rather perplexing order — at Hougang, even though he was at Bukit Panjang.

> Order pick up 20km away

> Speaking to Mothership, Dylan Chen explained that he rides a bicycle and is typically stationed in the west side of Singapore.

> He was however, ""unfortunate"" enough to be selected by Foodpanda to do a ""cycling marathon"".

> Chen received an order of fish soup that he had to deliver to a customer at Bukit Panjang Ring Rd.

> However the food was to be picked up at Hougang Ave 4, roughly 20km away from his location.

> The app stated that he would earn S$5 from the assignment.

> Chen then tried to contact Foodpanda's customer service.

> After apologising for the inconvenience caused, the customer service staff stated that Chen would have to carry out the order as he had already accepted it.

The article suggests that the delivery person had to accept the order. Do delivery persons get to see where they need to collect the order from and where it needs to be delivered before accepting the delivery?,3,2020-11-24,21:36:21
"Fuck FP's treatment of the riders. Two weeks ago there was an unannounced earnings cut of about 60 cents + 70 cents per order. That adds up a lot. After the earnings cut, Foodpanda is officially the worst paying food delivery service for riders. There is literally no upside of working for Foodpanda compared to Grab now.

When its raining, no choice but to do if you have a shift that day.

The app also glitches a lot. Just like in this post. Sometimes when offered a delivery, the app doesn't even show the riders the food pick up point and destination the rider decides whether to decline or accept the order. 

In addition, if you got book shift, sometimes they suka suka just remove your shift and give it to another rider.

Ever since FP opened up more shifts and dropped earnings as you said, it's not worth the time. While Grab has a lot more riders in comparison, the bar for getting incentives is much lower compared to FP and you have a 10% buffer for acceptance/cancellation respectively, so there's more room for error compared to FP, where we're not even allowed to make 1 mistake and have to hit over a certain number of relative hours to hit Batch 1

"Speaking as someone who delivers on weekend with panda as well as someone who uses it - Their CS is the worst experience I've ever faced.

It does not help that their CS/support team do not appear to be local - this is important as they are unable to relate to the riders frustrations on location bugs (east side pin deliver west side etc.) on the app.

Never in my life have I faced support that actively try to not support you. They need an entire overhaul ASAP. My GF faced the email/phone number decoupling issue also - till this date not resolved (raised ticket Jan - attempted multiple times just for them to say check the email when the email cannot be accessed anymore).

They are either blind, unable to comprehend English, or actively sabotaging the company as long as the ticket appears to be an issue that cannot be resolved within 5 mins.

"The problem is not with technology but how you implement it and care about your user’s experience. 

They probably have removed your email from the account attached to your old number. 
This happens when they allow user to login or create a new account with just mobile and OTP verification with some rules to validate if it’s actually you.

The user who has your old number must have already taken over ur account and your email is overwritten. 

This is one of the pitfalls of using mobile number as the only unique identifier of accounts. Especially for Singapore where we have recycled mobile numbers. 

They should have simply created a new account and replaced your old account with a dummy mobile number so that your account can still be recoverable by you via email.

"Here to shed some light on what happens on the other end as the agent. Long read ahead so be warned. Or just skip to the end for the tl;dr.

To set the record straight, I have NEVER worked for FoodPanda so it’s not like I’m trying to defend the company. Just here to share my experiences ◡̈ 

Having worked on the other side of the line as a CS agent, agents aren’t allowed to freely dispense info and generally have template answers to follow. If you deviate from it, you could get in trouble as many times there are things that the company doesn’t want the customer to know. During training the company will usually dictate the type of tone that you’re supposed to use as it reflects the image that the company wants to portray to the user. These days, there’s been a shift towards a friendlier, less formal tone (complete with use of emojis). Not sure why but probably to cater to a younger audience.

Also, queries that go beyond simple generic questions have to be escalated to the relevant internal teams and these teams more often than not, don’t care about the customer as it’s not their job to appease them. So CS agents often find themselves stuck, being unable to help as they don’t have the info needed to solve the customer’s query. All they can do is wait for the internal departments to get back to them. And in the meantime, the longer the customer waits, the angrier they get. But the other internal teams typically only work during office hours. Which means that weekend queries have to be put on hold until Monday, earliest.

But at the same time the CS agent is also the one having to deal with the customer’s wrath. CS agents don’t get paid enough for whatever sh*t storm customers throw at them throughout the day. The ratio of agents to customer queries can be anywhere from 1:10 if its a small company, to about 1:5,000 if its a big one. There are only so many hours in a day and only so much that the CS agent can do.

Some agents who have been doing this for a long time just stop caring. Because there is just no point. The customer will forever be angry and the company will forever refuse to admit that their practices are subpar. I’m not saying this should excuse agents from showing a bad attitude to customers. I have definitely seen agents who can’t be bothered and are just doing the job for some simple pocket change.

TL;DR CS agents are also just people who are trying to do their jobs at the end of the day. There’s only very little they can do beyond handling simple generic queries cos they really only have access to very basic information. Don’t get mad at them if they have to ding dong your query to other teams. They have to ding dong it to even get some form of answer to tell the customer 🤷🏻‍♀️

I was overcharged at least three times and had to go to customer support for it. I told customer support to calculate my bill, and they basically repeated the bill to me. For example, $100 meal that’s 55% off costs like $47.78. It’s not even GST. Or applying discount before GST and adding GST back. Nope.

And the customer support will reply that there are no calculation errors. I’ve stopped using that app because their customer service support clearly can’t do basic math and their developers can’t do configure formulas that auto-calculate correct numbers.",2,2020-09-17,01:47:00

Preach it! Using phone numbers is damn stupid. Phone numbers change. Use a username.

Used to work for Deliveroo as a rider ops manager for a while. Everyone there from CEO down has to do at least one slot of deliveries a month to stay connected to how hard the delivery rider's job is. 

Happy to see you giving credit when it's due!

The gig economy is hard, but it can be rewarding if you play it right. There is nothing wrong, shitty, or demeaning with being a delivery rider long-term - any more than it is to be a construction worker, toilet cleaner or do any honest job to support yourself and family. 

Your slightly Dickensian reference to ""station"" in society only confirms what we know - we in Singapore are classist and status obsessed. But really, as long as you can pay for your essentials, your job does not define who you are. I learned that the hard way, when facing an identity crisis after losing a job several years ago.

The question isn't whether the rider will rise in society. Social trajectories aren't assuredly upwards.

I very much went backwards before, during, and after the CB. I'm self employed with my own business that relies upon people being able to get together in groups. For almost four months I earned next to nothing -like around $250 a month. Terrifying. 

Would I do a job that I hated to survive? Absolutely. Would I be ashamed? No. Would I be ok with having such a large part of my day devoted towards something that didn't fulfill me, definitely not. 

I guess what I meant to say has to do with fulfillment as a human being. If someone looks forward to delivering food and that's what they do for the majority of their day, then they are far ahead of a lot of people.

What's interesting is this:

>This isn't the first time that Foodpanda's self-improvement advice to customers was not taken well.

>In May, another customer complained that he was denied a refund and was also told to improve his order success rates after reportedly receiving three defective orders within a single week.

>However, in a subsequent email, the Foodpanda customer care team appeared to admit that the missing order was a result of ""heavy load of orders"" at the restaurant in question and granted him a refund in what they called a ""one-time exemption"".

1) Now a day delivery guy left on the spot after handling it over to you.

2) As you cross-check receipt to physical, you have to open up. As it is no longer in the delivery guy line of sight.

3) What do you expect the delivery guy to do, if there's something missing? Vomit one out? Ask him to return it (if stolen/forgotten)? Ask delivery to pay back?

"I’m a PT food delivery rider and I see customers’ typical delivery fees ranging from $3-$4.50 and GrabFood topping up $0.50-$1.50.

Can I ask how much north your fees have climbed up? Because the delivery guys’ earnings have been going south. 

Also, GrabFood has recently forced assigned its riders to deliver more orders per trip (going to 2-3 restaurants and delivering to 2-3 customers) which equates to even less payout on their part to the rider. They say it’s for riders to plan their trip better which we all know is complete BS. 

So if you’re customer2 and ordered from just 3 streets away, you could get your food over an hour later. Worst scenario: their allocation algorithm is random and they assigned your job to a rider 20 streets away from the restaurant. Poor rider is also assigned another order to collect and deliver before delivering to you. Just so happens restaurant1 came up with a promo and are short handed and only starts cooking when the rider reaches. So he rides for 15mins to the restaurant and waits another 30mins, then goes to restaurant2. thankfully your food is already ready but has gone all cold! He then proceeds to deliver to customer1 which takes another 10mins before finally delivering to you.

So we get an angry customer who got their food cold and late. A tired rider who had to go 2 different locations far-away. A restaurant who still complains about the commission rates even as their promo is selling but their reputation is hurt because the food is cold.

Oh, I haven’t taken into account the weather and road conditions, customers who just can’t answer the door and expect to be called. Customers living in condos who take forever to answer the intercom, condo management that wants your rider to park outside and walk all the way in.

Can’t fault you for wanting to pay in cash but the least you could do is pay in exact and not flash that $50 note for a $10+ meal. As for incomplete delivery, that’s a sticky situation.",9,2020-08-31,09:14:14
"Yes, it was - thanks! Not sure why the link failed.",2,2020-08-31,14:51:31
"Insightful. Thank you. 

How often do customers tip? Does the customer’s rating of the driver or tips to the driver have any influence ( E.g. on the order allocation or the commission to the driver ) ?",3,2020-08-31,10:28:15
"you should ask yourself how often do you tip? There is absolutely nothing wrong with not tipping because it's ingrained in our local culture. I personally do not tip unless I felt the service rendered deserves it but more often than not, the overall customer's experience is soured due to little/no fault of the rider. So no tip ultimately. Ha!

As earlier highlighted, slow delivery even though its 3 streets away, missing food items due to restaurant missing out. I once traveled back because the restaurant called AFTER I had delivered the item. (the customer must have called to check where the drinks were) 

So that's 10mins to and 10mins fro to get something that was missed out. When I went back, the restaurant still had the cheek to say they put it there and I didn't take when I was all along waiting and when they called, they handed the bag to me and that was it. You may argue, you should at least check the drinks but sometimes fatigue sets in, you'll just take whatever order number and go. 

so in total 20 mins wasted. Did I expect to get a tip for going 2 rounds, yes. Was I tipped, no. Anyway, thinking back, I did not have to fulfill the missing order because I was already assigned a new order after my 1st trip. Usually, GrabFood would have settled it with the customer. But I guess there has been rampant abuse. And we all know getting to support hotline even as a customer is terrible.

Finally, to answer your question, full amount of tip goes to the rider. So ratings do not matter. Grab's rating system is flawed because I never got to see the bad ratings given and usually they are written off unless it is something very serious. So, as of now, I'm still a 5-star unblemished rider. Haha.

And less than 5% of customers tip (at least for me). so that's 1 tip of maybe loose change to $1-$3 out of 25 trips made. 

**Pathetic is an understatement.**

So yes. some of you should validate what they meant by **delivery fee** keeps rising or do they mean overall marked up food prices? I personally would not pay $4 delivery fee for a single $6 McD ($5 dine in) filet meal . But would consider that for 4xfilet meals.",2,2020-08-31,11:03:36
"Thanks. I add a SGD 2 tip to every order ( I order via Deliveroo).

"that's very nice of you.

The in-app tipping is good because for me, it comes as a surprise and that someone appreciates my service when I look into my virtual wallet at the end of the day. But I don't have the opportunity to thank the tipper.

"Ok I did some math and here's what I got:

The discount is applied on the pre-GST undiscounted price, but GST is charged based on the discounted price that you first see on the menu.

So in your case, the GST is charged on 13.93 (which is the subtotal shown on the menu screen), but the discount value is (19.9/1.07) * 30% = 5.58

For some odd reason, they're then using the pre-GST discount value and deducting it from the post-GST original price to achieve your final payable amount (in this case, 19.90 being the post-GST original price). 19.90 - 5.58 = 14.32 which is what you're seeing (it is hella weird tho).

EDIT: the 19.90 total you see on the payment screen is already inclusive of GST.",21,2020-10-14,18:22:42

"> # Man gets jail for ordering more than S$700 worth of food from GrabFood and Foodpanda without paying

> SINGAPORE: Over almost three weeks, a 27-year-old man ordered more than S$700 worth of meals from food delivery applications, had them delivered to his neighbours' flats and ate them without making payment.

> For four counts of cheating, with an additional nine charges taken into consideration, Leonard Tan Tong Han was sentenced to seven days' jail on Thursday (Sep 17).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Tan stayed in a 14th-floor flat in Choa Chu Kang, and carried out the deception by having food delivered to his neighbours' flats on the floors just above and below his.

> The court heard that Tan made several food orders on the GrabFood and Foodpanda mobile applications between Feb 25 and Mar 14, with no intention of paying for his orders.

> He selected the ""cash on delivery"" payment option while ordering and before the food arrived, sent messages to the delivery riders telling them to leave the food outside the flat. He also told them he would make payment via PayLah! or PayNow.

> When he saw that the food had arrived, he would go to his neighbours' flats and collect the food from outside the flats. However, he did not make payment for the orders.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> To carry out his scheme, Tan set up multiple accounts on the food delivery apps with fictitious names and random phone numbers so that he could not be subsequently contacted.

> In one of the incidents on Mar 8, Tan ordered food from a restaurant in Gangsa Road via the Foodpanda app, under the fake name ""Sammy Leong"".

> He selected the ""cash on delivery"" option for the S$91.59 order, which he arranged to be delivered to his neighbour's flat on the 13th floor.

> In his order remarks on the application, Tan wrote: ""Leave food above shoe rack ... picking kids up from hospital. Just sms me your paynow number I will paynow and whatsapp you.""

> The delivery rider placed the food on the shoe rack outside Tan's neighbour's flat, sent a photo of the delivery to a number Tan had given him and left.

> DELIVERY RIDER SENSED SOMETHING WAS AMISS

> Tan later picked up the food, but the food delivery rider sensed something was amiss when he received no reply to his photo. He returned to the flat and saw that the food was gone.

> The rider knocked on the door of the flat, but the neighbour told him he had not placed any food delivery orders, adding that there had been similar incidents.

> The rider reported the case to Foodpanda. The neighbour had filed a police report earlier on Feb 25, over two pizza delivery orders that had been sent to his home.

> The total losses sustained by GrabFood and Foodpanda came to S$718.54. Tan has repaid the companies in full.

> The judge allowed Tan to serve his sentence on Oct 1.

> For each charge of cheating, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined or both.

Unfortunately most of the theft and cheating crimes in the Penal Code are property-centric, i.e. they deal with property and not services

Wage theft would not easily fall under those defined offenses in the Penal Code.

There is a regulatory regime under our labour laws, i.e. Employment Act and Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, but MOM enforcement is spotty. It's no secret where our enforcement priorities lies, and it's also no secret that Singapore treats and has long treated migrant workers shabbily.

There is an excellent position paper by HOME about the practice of wage theft and wage exploitation in Singapore - easily googleable. This issue is also somewhat of interest to me, i  volunteered at a migrant worker NGO for a while and witnessed many outrageous/exploitative practices esp by construction companies.",2,2020-09-18,09:59:44

"Actually i stand corrected. There's a new section 420A([https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr420A-#pr420A-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr420A-#pr420A-)) in the Penal Code which criminalizes fraudulently or dishonestly obtaining services.

This was just amended last year and came into effect in Jan 2020 this year, which does underscore the point that historically, the law was far more concerned about protecting people's property rights (whether tangible or intangible) rather than being cheated of services.

But i think your larger question is what separates a breach of contract (which would result in a civil claim) from a cheating offence (which would result in criminal prosecution).

The mental element of proving fraud or deception is a necessary element for the offence. This is a very high threshold to prove in reality.

In this Grabfood case, the fraudulent and deceptive conduct is clearly borne out, and his intent can be readily inferred from his numerous pattern of past orders.

A one-off failure to pay your SGH medical bill is not likely enough to plausibly give rise to an inference of fraud.

From an enforcement point of view, the police and prosecutors aren't going to sieve through the hundreds of dishonoured transactions everyday to see whether they have a basis of charging someone for an offence or not.",0,2020-09-18,13:53:01

In your world of logic probably, no one ever argued that he was entitled to do that.

"Foodpanda live chat responses has to be some copy pasta shit. No decent human being in their right mind types like that. What they don't get is that customers using their live chats are not in a good mood and the general tone of the copy pasta and emojis just serve to make customers more pissed off.

"Speaking as a weekend rider for then - their service/support is shit tier. I dread contacting them so much i personally issue refunds to customers direct than make them request for one.

I dont understand why they cant hire a local team for support. Alot of the queries from riders ahd customers are pretty bog standard and just require some contextual/local knowledge a bot might not pick up.

They need a full restructure of the dispatch and service team. In addition they need to tone correct their marketing towards riders with regards to incentives.",6,2020-08-25,01:19:24
"Deliveroo > Grab > Foodpanda.

I had a problem last month with one of my vouchers — every time I email in (since live chat only works if there's an order placed), I get someone else, and I would have to explain my issue again. One CSO even gave me a voucher code that expired _two weeks before_ my email.

I believe their Facebook page is manned by more competent people (but still facepalm-level). You can try posting a comment to one of their posts, and hopefully they'll ask for your ticket number and take a look at it.

My issue hasn't been resolved, but I pretty much gave up. Some of Foodpanda's promos are good, but their service recovery is a _huge_ waste of time if things go wrong.

> All of the refunds is due to them double charging me which btw the first few agents vehemently denied i was double charged until i showed my bank statements. Only then did the agreed but instead of doing a lump sum refund they have been slowly processing each individual refund and everytime i bring this up their CS agents will be like “don’t worry you’ll get your money back ❤️” siao.

File a dispute with your bank. Double-charging is a valid reason within Visa/Mastercard to file a dispute. [I did so with TPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i4psi2/psa_if_you_have_a_tpg_line_you_might_want_to/).",6,2020-08-24,21:57:51

"Never had a good experience with them.

1. Ordered pizza in with colleagues, and despite the restaurant saying that our order was ready, the rider never turned up. Since it was near enough, my boss drove out and collected it instead. Rider never ever showed up.
2. A couple of years, later, thought they might have improved and gave them a second chance. Ordered in pizza (again!), got a call from the restaurant directly to ask me if I wanted to change an item which was OOS, which I did. Food came, I thanked the rider and thought wow, they are ok this time round, only to discover a missing item (not the aforementioned earlier). Called back the outlet and they never picked up, and ended up having to haggle with CS. Got a $5 voucher but never used it as I gave up on Foodpanda.

Contacted the useless CS only for them to tell me to wait patiently for half an hour more and to check outside my door (which I checked) and they only agreed to a refund after I started scolding them.

They offered to give me a 5% discount code for my trouble, which is obviously ridiculous. We’ve already cooked instant noodles by then, and the food is obviously in questionable condition if it was a delay by the driver. It was only when I brought up food safety violations did they reply IMMEDIATELY and issued an immediate refund.",2,2020-08-25,18:55:28

But today I just had a shitty experience where the rider placed my food at the WRONG GATE.

The customer service just told me to keep checking outside my door when I said multiple times I don’t see it there and I even took a pic of my neighbour’s door and asked if that is where he hung the food. 

Eventually they checked and said ya he hung it on the wrong gate. Told me to check and then didn’t even apologise what the fuck. So done.",2,2020-08-25,22:26:45
"I once ordered minced meat noodles and requested for sambal chilli.  
This is one of those dishes that I don't enjoy without the chilli.  
To me, eating minced meat noodles with no chilli is like eating steak well done without any salt, pepper or sauces.

Anyways, first order: no chilli.

Called up foodpanda CS and offered to make a second order immediately just so that they can bring the second order with enough chilli for both orders.

foodpanda CS assured me that he will make sure the next order went well but terminates the chat as I was making the order.

Food came with no chilli again. I rejected the order.

foodpanda CS refuses to refund either of my orders.

Only after unleashing my inner Ken did I get $10 vouchers.

I found out later that the foodpanda rider gave the second order to the security guard.

How did Deliveroo handle this similar situation?

The Deliveroo CS told me where I could find the restaurant's contact number and advised me to contact the restaurant if I have any dietary requirements.

No issues with my orders ever since.

Mee siam mai hum?

No problem, just call the restaurant, tell the restaurant my order number and my request.

EDIT:  
Why the downvote? 

It's not like I asked foodpanda to just deliver the chilli in itself.   
I offered and actually ordered the 2nd set just so that they can rectify the mistake.  
AND the foodpanda CS did assure me that the will get the next order right and so I expect him to keep his word, which he didn't.",5,2020-08-24,22:13:08

Thank you for choosing foodpanda.

foodpanda doesn't settle for anything short of perfection when it comes to delivering satisfaction to customers like you, so such a mistake is not something we can look past. I am sorry to hear that your cooking instructions for order gxxo-2xx1 with Cold Stone Creamery (The Gardens Mall) was not followed.

This is indeed not the type of experience we strive for. There can be unusual situations, which are contrary to the expectations. We hope that your next experience with us would be a good one.

We don't like average. We will get better. Promise!

I tried to fight for that because its pointless to do the 2 dollars refund if they are going to charge me 4.5... she refused so hard and I feel like im just wasting my time so I just hang up... I dont think its worth another 30 minutes just to even fight for that amount...

But let me get this straight.

foopanda provide a special request but customer cannot use it?

Minced meat noodles usually have the option of sambal chilli and vinegar but now the customer cannot ask for it?  
Btw, they updated the menu to have those options now so I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one requesting for it. 

foodpanda did not keep their word and I can't oppose that?  
If I cannot ask for the sambal chilli, foodpanda should just say it upright instead of agreeing for me to make the second order and promising that it will be righted.

"Alright, how do I to talk to the rider directly?

All I could do was use the rider chat, but the rider showed me that he did not get any message at all.   
Another rider who delivers to my area later told me their app sucks ass and that the message generally only appears when they reach the customer.

Yeah, the vendor is the problem, but so is the foodpanda CS. 

Can, say can. Cannot, say cannot. 

Don't promise something then don't deliver.  
And the foodpanda CS definitely has the ability to contact the rider and tell him to double check on the order before leaving the vendor.

I would've stopped at the 1st order if the foodpanda CS is just upfront about it.",0,2020-08-25,15:34:06
"A rider who says he can't see the message, is either lying or the facing some app problems.

When you order something thru the FP app, you can press the chat to message the rider. The rider HAS to reply a customer message before he can proceed with anything (pressing pick up/seeing address/pressing delivered)

In doing so, you will also be able to see the Rider's name from your notification bar.

IF rider decides to play punk, you have your order number and riders name.

Customers aren't the only one facing customer support issues. Us riders have our fair share of problems from Cx, vendor and support.",2,2020-08-25,15:41:03
"Am a foodpanda rider, can also confirm that the app sucks ass. Sometimes when I get a message notification from the customer, and once I open it, it will disconnect itself and I can't open the chat window anymore. The only clue is the brief heads up notification that I saw before tapping it, but I won't know the full message. Feedback countless times but nothing changed. 

So don't rely too much on the rider chat. If you want a foolproof way to get your message across to the rider, before you place your order, add it in the ""notes to rider"" in your address section. It will definitely show up on our app. But remember to clear it for the future orders. 

Also, don't bother with the CS, they are all outsourced to Pakistan now, probably. And they always like to end the chat before addressing concerns.",2,2020-08-25,15:52:16
