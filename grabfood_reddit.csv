"A true simple story of helping others!
Never knew calling for help is a busybody, the “man” probably is just lazy and unsympathetic,  using an uncomprehending excuse not to help. 

Not all busybodies is a Karen!

P.S. I also encountered an unconscious man during lunchtime with my grandmother 3yrs ago, I try waking him up but no response, I’m thinking he fainted so I called ambulance. Didn’t wait for them tho (grandmother getting hungry and complaining he’s just a drunk) but gave the location and my contact number. My grandmother is right, the police called back confirming he’s drunk. Lol!",2021-02-28 14:29:42
"A few years ago, an elderly man half-fainted while waiting for the MRT. He kind of sat down in the floor. It was like 7pm in the CBD area. Just then, the train came and everyone rushed onto it. I was standing there still deliberating  what to do when a Bangladeshi worker rushed up and started helping the man into a sitting position.

I decided to stay with them and helped translate cos the old man could only speak Mandarin and he wanted to call his son on the phone . I called station on the intercom thing (no staff on the platform). Station manager eventually came w a wheelchair and again, I was glad to help translate with my limited Mandarin.

I was so happy to be able to help the old Chinese uncle tell the Bangladeshi worker that he was very grateful for his help. I was able to reassure the concerned worker that the old man’s son was coming to pick him up.

While we were there waiting for the MRT staff, the worker held onto the uncle tightly, in case he might faint again. He kept speaking to him in a reassuring way too... 

TL;DR Bangladeshi worker didn’t hesitate to help a person as all the SG folk decided it was more important to catch the train 😕😞😒",2021-02-28 16:55:52
"Have worked as emergency doctor in A&E. 

Can confirm 98% of people who look drunk are drunk. 

But if you wrote off the remaining 2% as drunk and didn’t get medical attention for them, they’ld die a needless death. Diabetic comas (sugar too high / low), bleeding in the brain, head injury, extreme dehydration / infection, brain swelling from various conditions / tumours.

Human compassion got us to where we are today. Abandoning it in favour of sophistication would be truly ironic.",2021-02-28 17:10:52

"I'm not sure what's the reason behind this, but a big chunk of Singaporeans I deal with in my day-by-day life has an extreme lack of empathy, interest, ambition, and curiosity. I see every age and social status doing the minimum to achieve the shallowest accomplishments.

"I’m so disappointed in Singaporeans. Why are we so ambivalent and unhelpful generally? 

I recall being at a mall that was directly connected to the MRT station few years ago with my family. We just entered the mall and spotted an uncle struggling to walk - he eventually collapsed against the wall, obviously feeling unwell. My family assumed that he was drunk and told me not to bother, but I kept looking back and eventually asked him if he was ok. He said he was ok, but then fell against the wall. Luckily there was a mall staff nearby and he came over and tended to the uncle, who was not drunk but indeed feeling unwell. All this while, none of the other passers-by cared at all. I was so disappointed.",2021-02-28 20:12:55

"> # Woman in S'pore helps unconscious GrabFood delivery driver despite being called a busybody

> A GrabFood delivery driver was spotted curled up and unconscious on the floor on Feb. 26.

> A member of the public had come across the scene after alighting at the bus stop near her home.

> Called a busybody

> According to the Facebook post by Lily Ng, two other men were present at the scene, but reportedly did not check on the delivery personnel.

> Ng observed that the passers-by tended to ""just walk [past] him"".

> She then tried to wake the unconscious GrabFood delivery driver and when he did not respond, attempted to ascertain that he was alive by pressing on his stomach.

> Ng explained that she avoided his face due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

> However, when she attempted to approach someone to help in calling the ambulance, no one appeared willing to come forward to provide assistance.

> Ng wrote:

> ""I approached someone help to call ambulance but unfortunately and very sad no one willing to help. And one of the man (sic) told me don't be busybody because now is Covid-19 pandemic.""

> Ng proceeded to call for an ambulance on her own.

> She also sat down to wait for the ambulance to arrive, to ensure the delivery driver's safety before leaving the scene.

> In a follow-up comment, Ng said that the delivery personnel's blood pressure was reported to be very low when paramedics checked on him, but she did not follow-up after he was sent to the hospital.

> ""Help each other""

> Ng explained in her post that while she understood the panic during the pandemic period, one could always call an ambulance from a distance.

> She appealed for more compassion to be shown in such scenarios:

> Every second count[s] and you never know just one call can save a person's life. All this GrabFood delivery man, they are risking their lives too to deliver food to our table and bring back money to support their family. I hope through this message everyone in Singapore will do your part [to] be united and be more compassionate to help each other.

"This happened about 15 years ago when I was in sec sch -  the bus I was on braked abruptly and a lady sitting on the middle seat in the last row was hurled forward. She could not get up and NONE OF THE ADULTS NOR THE BUS DRIVER came forward to check on her. Another student and myself were the ones who called the ambulance and her family. Because she couldn't move, the bus couldn't leave and everyone else got off the bus to wait for the next one. 

I couldn't understand the indifference then and it left such an impression. I'd like to think that the younger generation would be different but it's disappointing to see that 15 years later.. there are still many of these people around, even among my peers.",2021-03-01 10:59:49

There was a family that saw the whole accident and BARELY did anything but stare. The whole time i was on the floor trying to find the strength to push myself to stand up (albeit with only one working leg lol) and yet they don’t even bother calling for help or at least a “are you okay” question. 

after that i finally understand why there’s a “kindness movement” because singaporeans are truly selfish scums lol

> Ku took a closer look at the chair, and Mala's colleague then asked him if he would be able to fix it.

> He replied that he would try.

> And proceeded to spend the next one hour figuring out what went wrong and completely dismantling and reassembling the chair.

> It turns out that Mala and her colleagues had used the wrong screw when connecting the various parts, a piece of information which Mala noted the instructions failed to include.

> Mala then expressed her gratitude to Ku who decided to extend a helping hand to them.

> She wrote that for delivery riders, time lost was income lost.

> She and her colleagues also tipped the rider S$10 as a token of appreciation for his kindness and patience.

> Although Ku initially refused, he eventually accepted the cash after much persuasion.

"> # Man gets jail for ordering more than S$700 worth of food from GrabFood and Foodpanda without paying

> SINGAPORE: Over almost three weeks, a 27-year-old man ordered more than S$700 worth of meals from food delivery applications, had them delivered to his neighbours' flats and ate them without making payment.

> For four counts of cheating, with an additional nine charges taken into consideration, Leonard Tan Tong Han was sentenced to seven days' jail on Thursday (Sep 17).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Tan stayed in a 14th-floor flat in Choa Chu Kang, and carried out the deception by having food delivered to his neighbours' flats on the floors just above and below his.

> The court heard that Tan made several food orders on the GrabFood and Foodpanda mobile applications between Feb 25 and Mar 14, with no intention of paying for his orders.

> He selected the ""cash on delivery"" payment option while ordering and before the food arrived, sent messages to the delivery riders telling them to leave the food outside the flat. He also told them he would make payment via PayLah! or PayNow.

> When he saw that the food had arrived, he would go to his neighbours' flats and collect the food from outside the flats. However, he did not make payment for the orders.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> To carry out his scheme, Tan set up multiple accounts on the food delivery apps with fictitious names and random phone numbers so that he could not be subsequently contacted.

> In one of the incidents on Mar 8, Tan ordered food from a restaurant in Gangsa Road via the Foodpanda app, under the fake name ""Sammy Leong"".

> He selected the ""cash on delivery"" option for the S$91.59 order, which he arranged to be delivered to his neighbour's flat on the 13th floor.

> In his order remarks on the application, Tan wrote: ""Leave food above shoe rack ... picking kids up from hospital. Just sms me your paynow number I will paynow and whatsapp you.""

> The delivery rider placed the food on the shoe rack outside Tan's neighbour's flat, sent a photo of the delivery to a number Tan had given him and left.

> DELIVERY RIDER SENSED SOMETHING WAS AMISS

> Tan later picked up the food, but the food delivery rider sensed something was amiss when he received no reply to his photo. He returned to the flat and saw that the food was gone.

> The rider knocked on the door of the flat, but the neighbour told him he had not placed any food delivery orders, adding that there had been similar incidents.

> The rider reported the case to Foodpanda. The neighbour had filed a police report earlier on Feb 25, over two pizza delivery orders that had been sent to his home.

> The total losses sustained by GrabFood and Foodpanda came to S$718.54. Tan has repaid the companies in full.

> The judge allowed Tan to serve his sentence on Oct 1.

> For each charge of cheating, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined or both.

">It sounds like wage theft would also qualify even though those cases are usually civil

Unfortunately most of the theft and cheating crimes in the Penal Code are property-centric, i.e. they deal with property and not services

Wage theft would not easily fall under those defined offenses in the Penal Code.

There is a regulatory regime under our labour laws, i.e. Employment Act and Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, but MOM enforcement is spotty. It's no secret where our enforcement priorities lies, and it's also no secret that Singapore treats and has long treated migrant workers shabbily.

There is an excellent position paper by HOME about the practice of wage theft and wage exploitation in Singapore - easily googleable. This issue is also somewhat of interest to me, i  volunteered at a migrant worker NGO for a while and witnessed many outrageous/exploitative practices esp by construction companies.",2020-09-18 09:59:44
"Go read up intent in law. The employer at no time deprived the workers of food, water and even had their mobile phones with them.

- the employer continued to employ them despite their colourful history. Why wouldn't you just sack them for misconduct wash and hire other people?

But there you go. I won't return to this discussion, so have a good evening.",2020-09-17 19:33:34
"Actually i stand corrected. There's a new section 420A([https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr420A-#pr420A-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr420A-#pr420A-)) in the Penal Code which criminalizes fraudulently or dishonestly obtaining services.

This was just amended last year and came into effect in Jan 2020 this year, which does underscore the point that historically, the law was far more concerned about protecting people's property rights (whether tangible or intangible) rather than being cheated of services.

But i think your larger question is what separates a breach of contract (which would result in a civil claim) from a cheating offence (which would result in criminal prosecution).

The mental element of proving fraud or deception is a necessary element for the offence. This is a very high threshold to prove in reality.

In this Grabfood case, the fraudulent and deceptive conduct is clearly borne out, and his intent can be readily inferred from his numerous pattern of past orders.

A one-off failure to pay your SGH medical bill is not likely enough to plausibly give rise to an inference of fraud.

From an enforcement point of view, the police and prosecutors aren't going to sieve through the hundreds of dishonoured transactions everyday to see whether they have a basis of charging someone for an offence or not.",2020-09-18 13:53:01
"> your employer is entitled to lock you up for 40 days with only fear of a fine

In your world of logic probably, no one ever argued that he was entitled to do that. The proposition the whole time was that the punishment handled down based on the evidence and circumstances presented was fair and in accordance to the intent of each crime.   As an employer, he should have known better otherwise. But did he did out of ill-will and malice? Clearly not. Else the judge would have handed down a jail sentence.",2020-09-17 19:48:02
