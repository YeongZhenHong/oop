3,helmimira,"After Helmi got terminated with his previous job during pandemic period, it feel disaster and stress out. Worried if we can't manage our financial. Thank god all is well after he started to work as FT rider.For the first few week, he shared his feelings on how he endure with unreliable people. I got pissed off the way he keep sighing. I told him just stay calm and work as per normal. At the end of the day, you will deserve the good deed you've been through.It is true, some of them don't care about rider situation. Especially when they said, Why you so late, you got no change ah, don't become rider la if you cannot deliver on time. 😑To those no sense of humor, you don't work as a rider. Please don't blindly blame. You wouldn't know what they have been through. Be it waiting time to collect your order or while on the road. If you feel not right, you can always message or call to check the status.To all rider, ride safe and smile behind the mask. If customer not happy with your service, talk to them in a nice way. If you get the crazy wild boar, then you guys start the tactic move back sir! Hehe..Moral of the story, don't sigh and stay cool. 👍Glad that he still continue with his job. 🤲❤🏍#iamproudofyou #frontliner #foodpanda #foodpandasg #hustledemihasil #iloveyouhusband 😘"
