Hey bro- how much is the light? Would like to buy one for you via lazada and shopee. Just to thank delivery riders for their hard work. The lot of you got us through some tough times last year. Just reach out to me,2021-03-03 21:15:13
"hey OP, do let us know if you ended work safely today. I dont really use food delivery that often but recognise how hard you guys work...would be happy to get you a replacement torchlight",2021-03-03 21:36:18
Just cover it with a cloth face-mask. Probably no one will dare touch it.,2021-03-03 21:20:51
"Make a police report. If there are CCTVs anywhere that caught where the thief went then he can be caught. Sometimes they can even trace the thief all the way back to his home. I know its a very big hassle for just a torchlight, but if everyone do this then it will be hard to steal things in future.",2021-03-03 20:55:06

"Some riders have headlights strapped on their upper arm and forehead. The ones on their arms are usually flashing. That might be an option to consider since the light will be on you at all times. Those are fairly affordable and can be found at Daiso. 

Sorry that this happened to you.",2021-03-03 22:20:27

only managed to test the torchlight at home 😓",2021-03-03 19:58:33
"If you have parked your bicycle at a hdb lobby, usually there should be security cameras which may be able to help u identify the thief. Maybe the thief was banking on you not reporting for stolen torchlight as it seems to minor.",2021-03-03 20:39:02
"I'll echo what some others have already said, to make a police report. Even if they fail to solve your particular case, it will add a mark on that area and no Police Station wants to be the one with the most active ""crime-zone"". Patrols will increase, and hopefully should the thief attempt another crime, will get caught and save the next victim.

EDIT\] Best outcome of course is they catch the bugger and return your torchlight, but regardless, just make a police report.",2021-03-03 21:13:09
What's wrong with these people? Sorry it happened to you man,2021-03-03 20:40:02
Sorry to hear that man. People can be horrible sometimes. Is your torchlight locked on to your bike or can it be easily dismantled out?,2021-03-03 20:00:46

"Hey! You should get those easily detachable kind of bike light. I had an expensive $30 one which was stolen one day too. Just remember to make it a habit to detach those modules when you get off the bike. Might be a hassle but definitely less than if you had to buy a new one.

Like why do people even steal a torchlight FFS,2021-03-04 09:22:15
The thief isn't desperate. The consequences to the victim potentially are huge.  The punishment in this and other cases where the motivation is so undeserving of sympathy should not have a possibility to be light in spite of the torch not being super expensive itself. Damage to society as a whole by letting this kind of nonsense go easily is far worse than the face value.,2021-03-04 12:05:13
I feel you bro. My torchlight (AND REAR LIGHT) also got stolen (I parked it for just over a day). Assholes man I don't leave lights on my bike anymore,2021-03-03 22:02:35

I would suggest get a powerbank operated one via USB and zip tie the damn thing so it can’t be stolen, or you might have to find a light that can screw on with clamp to the handlebar.

That light is great, too, it has an actual good pattern with a vertical cut-off so the light goes onto the road, not into oncoming motorists' eyes.

This uses an allen key for attachment, they *could* still steal it if they had one but it's much less likely. You could also replace the regular allen-head bolt with a [security bolt](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33048888632.html), these just use a Torx head with a pin that you need a [particular tool](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000687541265.html) to remove, that a random opportunist is very unlikely to be carrying.

The other alternative is to take it off. There are mounts [that are open to the top](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32735169560.html) that it's much easier to to pull the light out of quickly. If you are taking it on and off constantly, it has to be super-easy to do or you will get frustrated or not do it.

Delivery riders surely can punch you silly, but so can almost anyone in their prime. What's your point here?

The rider said the shop ran out so they told him to pass this to me instead which was also fucking wrong value. No way would I pay $5 for that knock off chocolate. I said no but the rider begged me to just take it saying he will need to ride back to the shop to return. It was really a WTF moment.

Ok then i asked for refund & received my refunds  about 3 days later.

Sometimes i wish these apps can inform customers if a particular restaurants have a high demand or if they are short of riders in a certain areas.

This would at least inform customers of their shortage of riders or if the restaurants has high demand so that customers can switch to grab/deliveroo or used other method.

Some restaurants can also be at fault for missing order/certain items has gone out ot stock,something that happen last year when my dad ordered prata for breakfast,only to receive some items missing.he tried to contact the CS,but they can't help it if the restaurant not willing to admit the mistakes.No refund as of now.",2021-03-18 20:34:50

The best part was,the receipt charged the total cost instead of the total cost of the snack.If i remember last time,you spend above $15 got free delivery.End up,i make a complained & ask for a refund for the missing item.

Interesting thing is that the PSA says any interest earned from e-wallet moneys should accrue to the user unless otherwise agreed.

I once ordered Mac for $13, the order was screwed up by Mac themselves except for the drink.

The agent then proceed to tell me I can either get a refund of $3, or a compensation voucher of $5 that can be use for future orders. 

Of course like any sane customer with a brain, that doesn't even make any sense. Why would I, who received the wrong items accept that offer, the $3 refund in fact only covers the cost of the drink that I actually received correctly. I questioned the agent, he/she then proceed to say ""yes and that's why i asked if you received the order partially, and you said yes"". Like cmon, all they are trying to do is to fish for a response that can let them refund as little as possible.

Sinkies pwning sinkies again. What's new?,2021-02-21 00:49:28
Foodpanda just doesn't give a shit... Almost non existent customer support,2021-02-21 02:30:38
Yeah. They likely bought said “burner” SIM cards from foreign workers who returned back to their home country but didn’t cancel their account.,2021-02-21 13:36:11
These food delivery companies just don't give a fuck about customer service,2021-02-21 07:47:06
Also tied to bank accounts.,2021-02-22 02:03:04
They can use a temp number from a prepaid sim card,2021-02-21 09:09:47
Tell that to profit hungry corporations that don’t really care.,2021-02-21 01:25:18
Actually I propose giving option to delivery riders the option of not accepting cash orders.,2021-02-21 08:28:22
"Yeah I ordered Domino's this month and realise they accept only cards (epayments?) online. Whether or pandemic or pandemic as an excuse to stop harrassment, it's a decision made partially because riders are directly hired by the company instead of gig contactors.",2021-02-21 12:20:14
You need to register your NRIC even for prepaid SIM cards,2021-02-21 09:14:57
Deliveroo doesn’t face this problem. The others can do better.,2021-02-21 01:26:00
"for grabfood, riders have the default choice of only having cashless orders. to have access to cash orders, you specifically need to topup a certain account.",2021-02-21 14:31:26
"You get the same effect. No delivery rider will accept cash orders. They hate it. But the companies don’t care because they don’t take any of the risks but get the same amount of profit. So if you’re a profit-motivated company, why would you give your riders such an option that would eat into your profits? Because you wanna be nice?",2021-02-21 10:52:56
That would be a fair option,2021-02-21 08:31:25
"Same with McDelivery, they have their own riders",2021-02-21 13:26:01
"I see.. Wasn't aware of that, thanks for informing. I got a prank order from a few days ago but didn't report coz I thought prepaid sim card is anonymous.. Shall make a report soon",2021-02-21 09:40:26
There’s alot of way around this. You can buy a “tourist” prepaid card from overseas that work in Singapore. You can also buy prepaid cards on Carousell or on forums pretty easily too.,2021-02-21 12:54:14
That’s because deliveroo does not have as big a slice of the market here.,2021-02-21 09:32:42
That's why deliveroo cut their workforce when the other 2 surge ahead,2021-02-21 01:33:07

"Rider should've talked to the dispatch team from his side and get them to cancel if the shop is closed (I just did this as a foodpanda rider yesterday, so it can be done). As much as I hate talking to dispatch (says ""SG Dispatching"" but all outsourced lmao) and would not get any compensation at all for the effort to go to the shop, marking delivered even though it was not is just straight up fraud.

Edit: he also asked what your payment mode is. He probably won't pull this stunt if it was a cash order",2021-02-12 08:22:38
Stop using foodpanda. They have the worst customer service I've ever encountered.,2021-02-12 00:11:50
"The correct thing for the rider to do is to inform the dispatcher to cancel the order. 

He “dropped off” the order on the app so that he can gain the docket pay for this order without actually doing anything, and it also saves time waiting for the next order and travelling there (assuming he reached the vendor only to find out it’s closed). Utterly shameful and despicable behaviour. I’m sorry you have to go through this OP. 

Source: am a panda rider",2021-02-12 18:24:11
Foodpanda has the worst service. They cocked up several times and only offered a partial refund when I reported them to CASE. Report them,2021-02-12 04:51:43
"There are two types of people: those who use Grab Food, and those who will use Grab Food. My girlfriend insists on using FP and I can't believe you still can't see the rider in real time or tip them online afterwards (especially important in contactless delivery times, I want to thank to the guys who are literally keeping me alive and sane). 

I order a lot (like, daily) and once in a month or so there is a cock-up and Grab always refunded for me no questions asked. Last time my McD breakfast was delivered fine, but the Sausage Muffin had scrambled egg instead of sunny side up, they refunded the whole order because of that. 

As for your current situation: try chargeback if you can, if not, keep pressuring the customer care. It's a matter of principles.",2021-02-12 06:44:47
"Grab has way better customer service, although I can only speak for grab rides. Refunded me without much hassle for driver cancellation charges, wrong routes taken by driver (back when the price wasnt determined before riding)",2021-02-12 01:37:39

he ordered RM89+ worth of food but the shop took so long to prepare the food that he forget to check the phone, food rider called him couple of times, but his phone on slient(forgot to turn off) checked the phone couples minute later to see the order canceled.

Now Foodpanda CS refused to refund my brother as they say its customer fault for not answering phone calls, food rider ended with free food.",2021-02-12 11:50:03

Ordered 3 fast food meals and didn't get the drinks. Foodpanda only gave me a $1.60 refund and a $5 voucher.,2021-02-12 21:22:05
"I won't say Grab will settle no question asked. They will investigate, but eventually they will settle it as long as customers are reasonable I feel.

There was once, I ordered some noodle with extra fishballs, and other food. The order came without that noodle, or course no extra fishballs as well. I requested for refund. I was refunded the noodle, but not the extra fishballs. So I raised the request again. It took 1 or 2 days, but they verified the order and eventually refunded the fishballs. It is just $1.40 something I think, but I agree that it is about principle.",2021-02-12 10:02:40
"People talk a lot of shit about grab, but I once had a driver who was smoking during delivery and managed to get a full refund after emailing them a picture. 

I knew he was smoking because his fucking cig was in my prata wtf.

EDIT: Getting ahead of all the “I call BS” comments here, he basically dropped ashes into the plastic bag while he was biking, so the bag (and my prata) was filled with cig ash. 

I’d dig up the email but I don’t want to out the nice CSR who processed my complaint (and likely got the guy suspended)",2021-02-12 09:19:18
"You can see the rider in real time..

Same applies with refund",2021-02-12 09:59:50
I second this - Grab actually has the best outsourced call centre customer service I have encountered so far in Singapore. I patronise them over foodpanda/deliveroo solely because of that.,2021-02-13 10:48:56
"my grab order came spoiled and grab refused to refund me tmd. kp 3 x email, die also dunwan gimme partial refund even",2021-02-12 17:03:39
That’s really because foodpanda CS don’t ever read whatever you said/see the picture proof. They’d just copy and paste a template...that happened to me.,2021-02-12 10:26:27

Must be unlucky if ur orders keep getting messed up.,2021-01-23 19:18:17
No issues with refunds from foodpanda for me. One item did not arrive but it is probably due to the restaurant’s negligence. Had a chat with them which they requested for a photo of the other food and receipt. Was given a voucher that is the same price as the item that did not come (spend minimum $1 to redeem the next time). This is settled in under 5 minutes from waiting for an agent to successfully giving me the voucher in the app.,2021-01-24 00:19:26
I think the best thing you can do for yourself is not to order Foodpanda again.,2021-01-24 01:10:18

"Recently had same experience. It was weird when it started to use words like ""dear"". Now it makes sense that they are using bot.

Lol i just deleted the yesterday. Had two consecutive rounds of deliveries that took 2 hours to arrive. Way too long. The first one had me having to deal with their help chat after midnight.

"Had bad experiences with their customer service too. Bought a voucher off Shopee that gave the wrong value (I.e Bought $15 voucher which only contains $8 value) and their reply was basically, ""sorry can't do anything it's nonrefundable lol"".

Had to cycle through many other agents before someone had the brains to fix this error. 

Uninstalled the app after that.",2021-01-24 14:51:41
"Understandable. But I’ll probably still use it when ordering in McDonalds into camp as a couple of us tried using the McDonald app and website which couldn’t process our orders(possibly because it wad too big) and we had to resend it several times before it worked(although, we had to split the order in half) whereas we could do it easily with Foodpanda. Funnily enough, the Foodpanda came faster than the actual McDonald delivery app even though we used it later.

Then again, we collect at guardhouse so not like they can deliver wrongly",2021-01-24 16:49:25
"You should try lodging a complaint with GrabFood. The CS is probably based here in SG (or at least, sounded like it to me) but I have no need for “local” CS if they are just going to be snarky. The one time I complained about the possibility of my food being wrongly delivered (which turned out to be true), I was indirectly accused of lying, blamed for opting for “contactless delivery” (hello, the last I checked we are living in a pandemic) and needed to wait a week whilst they “investigate”. 

Foodpanda on the other hand, responded w an almost-immediate refund the last time there was a missing order (though IDK if this has changed).",2021-01-23 23:46:39

"The problem with outsourcing CS to another country:

• food ordered and still not delivered 2 hours later

• all restaurants in the area are now closed because of the delay caused 

• CS agent from another country tries to resolve the issue by recommending “another restaurant in your area” which is already closed for the night, because they did a quick google and don’t understand local operating hours. 

I wish I could say this was a one off thing but it’s happened at least 4-5 times where food is just not delivered after a 2 hour wait. Wait times just seem to get longer and longer and CS is pretty much useless. 

At this point I wonder how Foodpanda is staying in business - I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a money laundering operation.",2021-01-24 02:36:03

It's the fact that the customer service had not been very helpful in the times when it gets messed up or that they have asked us to wait on the chatline despite the fact that we have already waited before contacting the chatline. On one hand, it's a human error, on the other, it's a set of SOP set by the company that plus its method of handling that's causing the customer distress.

There were also times when their CS was helpful and efficient, which were more in the earlier days. Nowadays, it sort of devolved into an awful script and flowchart. Now, I haven't faced any problems that required contacting the CS for other apps, so I don't know but fp is starting to slack in this department.",2021-01-24 14:52:02

"We should learn how to forgive bad experiences, to which we all have our different limits as to how much we can forgive. I'm a rather optimistic person, and I think that making mistakes is fine as long there are steps taken to improve the situation and so continuing with fp was in some hope that things pick up. Because other than their customer service, everything else is pretty good, and I didn't see a real need to be too upset over the customer service that I probably interact with once every twenty orders. It was until the negative events became closer to each other recently and little was done to resolve it that I've decided that I've come to an end with fp. 

Just because your threshold for forgiveness is low, doesn't mean that everyone should not be more forgiving on a whole.",2021-01-24 14:48:42

"Uber, Grab, and all of their variants are basically running on a bubble created by *unconventional* monetary policy: Quantitative Easing by the USA's Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan or Negative Interest rate by the European Central Bank. There is basically so much practically zero interest loans on the market today that companies that haven't make a cent of profit still remain solvent. This is not unusual, for example, Airbus ran on a loss for decades chipping away Boeing market share; it could do this because France and Germany considered civilian airframe design and manufacturing to be important enough of a strategic concern that they use government funding to keep Airbus afloat. What exactly is the strategic asset of Uber and Grab for the US government?

In practice, this means a transfer of money from savers (in the regime of negative interest rate your money evaporate at the negative rate + inflation rate) to investors, which Central Bankers worldwide hope will trickle down to workers, which in all honesty, do; though in a rather inefficient manner.

Historical records showed that this is a bad idea. US Federal Reserve basically announced recently that they will go pedal to the metal with the money printing, consequences be damned. Their reasoning is simple: typically, they expect inflation to rise and employment rate will fall, but since neither has happened, they will continue. Somehow, their mandate also include improving the issue of gender and racial equality. *But*, we can be in a brave new world where this may work, somehow.",2021-01-24 08:25:21

Except that we’ve just experienced the greatest bull run in the history of the world?  And GME popped on Friday because the Fed has been pushing down interest rates? Pls la dude.  Claiming that bull runs are due to treasury and MP is just laughable.  MP merely affects the institutional investor climate but it does not affect stock prices directly in any way, or at least not in a way that is going to be obvious and same for all stocks and markets.  

By the way, you are still wrong about corporate debt I/r vs MP induced I/r.  Corporate debt interest is always significantly higher because the payments are non-guaranteed and have higher risk.  I suggest you go back to RJC and continue studying first before you come talk cock la bro",2021-01-24 13:05:33
">Except that we’ve just experienced the greatest bull run in the history of the world?  And GME popped on Friday because the Fed has been pushing down interest rates?

Exactly. Central Banks made money really cheap, bought up shares, stocks, and assets and push their prices up. The bull run has everything to do with their policy and nothing to do with any fundamentals. One adage of investment has been ""time in the market beats timing the market"" and ""the stock market will go up in the long run"". The long-term price movement of stocks and assets since 2008 or so has everything to do with Central Banks' balance sheet.

Retail investors can indeed speculate and drive very short-term movements but in the long run, it's up to the Central banks.

>institutional investor climate

When an institutional investor, and the biggest owners are Central Banks, it's impossible that they don't affect stock prices in anyway. Of course they do. Same issue with passive and index funds. Their assumptions that their actions will have negligible effects on the price is OK when they are small but once they go to dominate the market, it's impossible that their actions isn't affecting the market. Central Banks couldn't push trillions worth of liquidity into the market without driving up prices. Economics fundamentals and company performance has nothing to do with stock price anymore.

Orthodox economics is in the post-realism realm: their predictions and theories have no relation with reality. They couldn't predict shit. So why bother studying it?",2021-01-24 13:19:58
"> The bull run has everything to do with their policy and nothing to do with any fundamentals

Except that many of the stocks are still not recovered from pre Covid levels, and most that are up are just the safe stocks like FAANG or sectors that managed to profit during Covid?  Companies like PDD, BABA, AMZN, JMIA (e commerce), freelancing companies, digital payment services (e.g. PYPL, SQ, SE) are up (4x) because of government FP or MP? Really bruh?  It’s nothing to do with fundamentals?   

Macroeconomics play a big part in finance, but not the way you think.  It’s not the Fed or Central banks that is pushing stocks up, it’s the way the stock favourites have changed in a new Covid era.  Most stocks, as I’ve said, are still not recovered and not profiting off Covid.  The bull market, which I called a market, just actually refers to specific sectors and  firms.

> orthodox economics... couldn’t predict shit

This is your only point that I partially agree with, but I would like to point out that the reality that most people refuse to acknowledge is that most economics you learn in university is useless.  It’s too much theory and modelling and too little application on any side.  The economics academia scene in SG is pretty disappointing imho. 

It is also ironic that you think economic fundamentals and company performance has nothing to do with stock price, when your approach of what economic fundamentals is is wrong in the first place.  The economic fundamentals in a Covid era has benefitted some winners and chose some losers.  It’s as common sense as that and the only reason why you cannot see this is because of the bullshit education system and how it obfuscates everything with theoretical economics.",2021-01-24 14:14:09

"I have to say, all three have sucked at various points in time. 

Deliveroo has, more than once, not delivered orders because they could not find riders. They just kept changing the estimated arrival time until we cancelled (I’m talking teatime stuff for office ordered at 2pm that hasn’t arrived after 4pm and they still have no rider).

Foodpanda makes it insanely difficult to find the help chat, and then they go in these logical loops and keep doing stupid shit. Shit so stupid i was convinced the guy on the other side was a bot. And every time we disconnected because my screen locked while waiting for a reply, I got a new dumbass and had to repeat myself over and over. I usually only get a refund after I’ve wasted more than an hour. (Eg Foodpanda placed an order at a restaurant that was closed and replaced by a totally different restaurant, this was discovered by my rider who went to pick up the order and realised there was no such shop, and the customer service guy assured me my order would be delivered, called the rider and told him to go back, and called the ex employee of the restaurant and told him to prepare the order. When the rider called me back again I had to repeat my story. Took nearly 2 hours on the phone to get my $30 back). But they are often cheaper than grab.

Grab was only good because they had vouchers that drove down the cost of delivery. Once the vouchers are gone probably won’t use it except for self pickup.",2020-11-30 19:52:28

Second time: we ordered at 10am and they delivered at 1pm, again getting the order partially wrong. Third time was the same. We then abandoned them completely.

Grab is bleh but good example of market penetration pricing strategy.",2020-12-01 02:11:50

"The worst is when you order from a restaurant for multiple people, only get half the items cause theyre “out of stock”, but nope they dont call you or let you cancel the order because “theyve already started preparing it”.

"Agreed man. Grab support totally sucks. Today I had an order which supposed to deliver to my house but then the delivery address was some other random address. I called grab support and they said they cannot refund the order or at least restore the promo code I used. They will only be able to refund if their so called technical side is able to confirm there was a GPS glitch or something.

They told the rider to dispose of the food. Free meal for him I guess.",2020-12-01 10:46:08
Grabs pretty useless when it comes to support. Ordered some curry dish and only the rice/meat arrived. They ended up siding with the restaurant and gave me a one dollar voucher on a 25 dollar order. Stopped using them ever since,2020-12-01 18:08:05
"I have an unpleasant experience with Grabfood before but I felt that we were partly at fault so I did not pursue any further. But posting here because I'm curious to know if anyone has any 2 cents on whether Grab should be refunding us in our case.
Basically I helped my aunt order food via her Grab app for about 3 pax so it is a considerable amount of food. Address input was not fully complete (no unit number) and because my aunt is new to this whole food ordering thing she did not monitor her phone at all after we placed the order. Delivery man called twice, she did not hear her phone to pick it up. Around 10min passed before we realised and by then the whole transaction had been cancelled from Grab's end and there was no way we could call the delivery man back. Food did not arrive at all and Grab refused to give us refund. Thoughts? Should they have done so out of goodwill? Afterall we made payment for food that we did not receive at all. But on the other hand it is because we did not provide the full address.",2020-12-01 19:19:39

Yea, some grab driver charged me 10 dollar extra( on a 10 dollar trip) because he picked me up in the basement condo(the address I typed...) and I had the galls to tell him to drop me in the basement of another condo (the address I typed...)

Grab pretty much replied with a premade message and told me to suck it.Not worth the hassle to try to call them by person, I just decided to use grab less, will still suck them dry when they have promos.",2020-11-30 15:49:13

"Well their strong position in SG has led CDG to up their game, at least.

From my personal usage I find that shorter distance Grab's cheaper (and faster), but longer distance (at least 1/2 of SG) CDG is cheaper and the overall trip is faster because them taxi uncles drive like madmen (which I appreciate when late)",2020-11-30 16:41:29

I told Foodpanda. They called the rider and the ex employee of the restaurant and insisted that my order would be delivered. I nearly hit the roof. 

Ya, it was a lot of time wasted of like $30. But after a while the money is not the point. Not being cheated is the point.",2020-11-30 19:44:46

App set delivery to location A (approx 1km away) but comments input delivery to location B (approx 10km away) for a fare of $5. And I'm riding a bicycle, no way was I gonna cycle 10km.

Don't think mine was a glitch but a mistake on the customer's end. Called Grab support and they told me to deliver to location A even when I knew the customer (which I had also contacted to confirm delivery location) was at location B. I went through the standard motion, wait 5-10 min and disposed of the food.

Another Grab support staff did call me when I was already at location A and said the customer called and asked if I could return the food back to the restaurant while Grab re-assigns the delivery to a motorcyclist. 

Funny how they didn't try to resolve that when I was still at the restaurant and on the line with Grab support. They didn't want to compensate me for making another trip back so yea I rejected it.

&#x200B;

Oh yea, customer was lucky it was a cash delivery order. So he didn't lose any $ or had to clawback anything from Grab. I was the sucker who had to waste over 15min on the line waiting and getting instructions and seeking clawback from Grab, which they did.",2020-12-01 12:30:58
