Hey bro- how much is the light? Would like to buy one for you via lazada and shopee. Just to thank delivery riders for their hard work. The lot of you got us through some tough times last year. Just reach out to me,Gibbo236,2021-03-03,21:15:13,993

"Make a police report. If there are CCTVs anywhere that caught where the thief went then he can be caught. Sometimes they can even trace the thief all the way back to his home.

Like why do people even steal a torchlight FFS,Prestigious_Effort91,2021-03-04,09:22:15,3
The thief isn't desperate. The consequences to the victim potentially are huge.  The punishment in this and other cases where the motivation is so undeserving of sympathy should not have a possibility to be light in spite of the torch not being super expensive itself. Damage to society as a whole by letting this kind of nonsense go easily is far worse than the face value.,barackwater,2021-03-04,12:05:13,3

"I use [this light from AliExpress,](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33052501051.html) $15, mounts using a GoPro mount. They sell it with these dual out front mounts that also take a Garmin which is what I use but you can get [little individual mounts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32516607971.html) for it too if you don't have a Garmin, only a few dollars. That light is great, too, it has an actual good pattern with a vertical cut-off so the light goes onto the road, not into oncoming motorists' eyes.

This uses an allen key for attachment, they *could* still steal it if they had one but it's much less likely. You could also replace the regular allen-head bolt with a [security bolt](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33048888632.html), these just use a Torx head with a pin that you need a [particular tool](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000687541265.html) to remove, that a random opportunist is very unlikely to be carrying.

The other alternative is to take it off. There are mounts [that are open to the top](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32735169560.html) that it's much easier to to pull the light out of quickly. If you are taking it on and off constantly, it has to be super-easy to do or you will get frustrated or not do it.

Or finally, stick it on your helmet. I have a Lezyne mount on my helmet that takes a round flashlight-style light. Then it's with you all the time. Light on the helmet is nice too as you can easily direct where the light goes by just looking.",blorg,2021-03-04,12:13:17,3

"Can they do that? Those E-wallet operators will need to also have a capital markets services license to do any investment

Licensing aside, the Payment Services Act requires monies collected by payment accounts operators to be either ringfenced in a trust account or guaranteed by a bank, and I don't think any bank will take on guaranteeing the monies if they're gonna be subject to investment risk.",AureBesh123,2021-03-18,22:00:46,11

Not in my experience. I once had a issue with my grabdriver (he marked me as late when I wasn't) and I got $5 refunded... cept that refund went into the grab wallet. And it's still sitting there today.,MiloPengNoIce,2021-03-18,21:13:23,2
I'm not from Foodpanda but I think that with that ewallet you can reuse the money immediately after refund for a new order. If you want money back instead the credit card company might take days or weeks to refund you.,now_in_sg,2021-03-19,00:47:46,3

"I use deliveroo sometimes and haven’t had bad experiences so far (hope this won’t jinx it) but they refund the exact amount you paid (so if you die die gotta reorder the missing item then you have to cover the delivery fees again). But I still very much prefer foodpanda because it doesn’t have a minimum order value and the delivery fees can be a lot cheaper than other platform’s.

"Just last month,was ordering food on Saturday evening.

Ordered Macs & time stated about 30-40mins.Then time keep increasing to 1hr.Decided to chat with CS,took a long while before they came back with 'we are short of riders'.

Ok then i asked for refund & received my refunds  about 3 days later.

Sometimes i wish these apps can inform customers if a particular restaurants have a high demand or if they are short of riders in a certain areas.

This would at least inform customers of their shortage of riders or if the restaurants has high demand so that customers can switch to grab/deliveroo or used other method.

Some restaurants can also be at fault for missing order/certain items has gone out ot stock,something that happen last year when my dad ordered prata for breakfast,only to receive some items missing.he tried to contact the CS,but they can't help it if the restaurant not willing to admit the mistakes.No refund as of now.",soccerisgreat99,2021-03-18,20:34:50,2
"I did ordered Pandamart before around 1am,during the fasting month.I actually ordered Laundry detergents,body soap,shampoo & some snacks.

Ok lah waiting game comes,i decided to chat with the CS,they said high demand for Pandamart,but then i think back,got many customers meh order at late night.But i decided to put off maybe some riders were delivering in other areas,then when the rider came,i notice that Shampoo,Body Soap & Laundry detergent were missing & all that came was just some snacks.

The best part was,the receipt charged the total cost instead of the total cost of the snack.If i remember last time,you spend above $15 got free delivery.End up,i make a complained & ask for a refund for the missing item.

What the point of having the 'Remove it from my order' if the product has gone out of stock yet they charged the full amount?

They used to have some local CS,but it gone bad that most of their CS can't understand english.",soccerisgreat99,2021-03-19,00:41:25,1

I’m not a lawyer but the act only stipulates that *some* monies must be safeguarded as you describe. The proportion isn’t clearly defined and most likely is a custom agreement between MAS and the licensee,tonyp7,2021-03-18,22:18:05,3

"Same for me. I didn't want to activate the wallet function but they refunded grab cancellation fee to it. That amount was too small for grab rides, can't pay with a combination of card and wallet, and forcing us to activate the wallet just to transfer it back or top up for usage. Grab is definitely not my first option anymore.",SleepSleptSlapped,2021-03-18,23:10:06,1
Yes this is generally how it works. I've used other apps and when getting a refund I've been asked if I want it in credits instantly or wait some time for it to show up on my original payment card.,Technojerk36,2021-03-19,00:55:21,8

"That's plausible. the PSA's language suggest that there may be some leeway in that regard n MAS is indeed taking a lighter touch approach to protecting e-wallet moneys as compared to say, bank deposits

Although i would be surprised if the regulatory regime would countenance allowing them to invest wallet users' moneys

Interesting thing is that the PSA says any interest earned from e-wallet moneys should accrue to the user unless otherwise agreed. If you read GrabPay's T&Cs, they make you agree to assign all interest earned to Grab. So I suppose they do really earn some interest at least from this business..",AureBesh123,2021-03-18,23:31:06,3

"I design user flow for apps and websites. It's easy to think that this should be a choice, but wouldn't you be frustrated after a while to have to select it for each order?
And what about the other story of a guy who didn't want the rice when the shop went out of chicken? There is already a selector in the app also. The default is to keep the order if something is missing.
We make compromises to try and make the usage of the app as simple as possible. 
It will never be perfect.
